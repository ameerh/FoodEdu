<h2>Regions of the foot:</h2><br /><ul><br />	<li><em>Hind-foot</em> - as the name suggests, the hindfoot is the portion of the foot closest to the center of the body.

While it has several more joints than the hind-foot, it still possesses little mobility.</li><br />	<li><em>Fore-foot</em> - the fore-foot is composed of the metatarsals and phalanges.

The foot is connected to the body where the bones of the foot and ankle meet the tibia and fibula (the small bone to the outside of the tibia). The tibia is also responsible for holding up 85% of the weight that presses down on the foot in the standing position. The tibia and fibula are held together by a tough layer of connective tissue, known as the Interosseous Membrane. The membrane thickens at the lower part of the leg, in order to make the ankle more stable. These two bones connect with the talus by forming a sort of dish which the talus fits into. This dish is known as the mortise of the ankle joint.<a></a><strong>Talus</strong>The talus is something of an odd bone because of its strange shape and the fact that 70% of this bone is covered with hyaline cartilage (joint cartilage). The talus acts as a &quot;ball joint&quot;, playing the critical roll of connecting the lower leg to the foot. The talus is covered by so much cartilage because it connects so many different bones. The talus holds the ankle together by connecting to the lower leg with a ball joint, connecting to the calcaneous on the underside through the subtalar joint, and by helping connect the back part of the foot (hindfoot) to the midfoot via the talo-navicular joint. These series of connections allow the foot to rotate smoothly around the talus, as when you roll your ankle in a circle. Unfortunately, the talus has relatively poor blood supply, which means that injuries to this bone take greater time to heal than might be the case with other bones.<strong><em>Parts of the Talus</em></strong>The talus is generally thought of as having three or four parts:<br /><ul><br />	<li>The talar body including the &quot;dome&quot; of the talus</li><br />	<li>The talar neck</li><br />	<li>The talar head</li><br /></ul><br />The talar body is roughly square in shape and is topped by the dome. It connects the talus to the lower leg at the ankle joint. The talar head interacts with the navicular bone to form the talo-navicular joint. The talar neck is located between the body and head of the talus, and is remarkable because it is one of the few areas of the talus not covered with cartilage, and is one of the few places that blood can flow to in the talus.<a></a><strong>Calcaneus (The Heel Bone)</strong>The calcaneus is commonly referred to as the heel bone. The calcaneus is the largest bone in the foot, and along with the talus, it makes up the area of the foot known as the hind-foot. The calcaneus is something like an oddly shaped egg; hard cortical bone on the outside covers softer cancellous bone on the inside. There are three protrusions on the top surface of the calcaneus (the posterior, middle, and anterior &quot;facets&quot;) that allow the talus to sit on top of the calcaneus, forming the sub-talar joint. The calcaneus also joins to another bone at the furthest end, away from the lower leg  and toward the toes. At this end, the calcaneus connects to the cuboid bone to form the calcaneal-cuboid joint.<br /><h3><strong>Subtalar Joint</strong></h3><br />The talus rests above the calcaneous to form the subtalar joint. However, the talus does not sit directly on top of the calcaneus. Instead, it rests slightly offset toward the outside of the foot (the side nearest the little toe). This positioning allows the foot to cope with uneven terrain because it allows a little more flexibility from side to side. The subtalar joint doesn't move independently; it moves along with the talo-navicular joint and the calcaneo-cuboid joint, two joints located near the front of the talus.<br /><h2>Bones of the Mid-foot: Cuboid, Navicular, Cuneiform (3)</h2><br /><a></a><strong>Cuboid</strong>The cuboid bone is the main bone of the mid-foot. It is a square-shaped bone on the outside of the foot, and possesses several places to connect with other bones. The main joint formed with the cuboid is the calcaneo-cuboid joint. Farther along its length, the cuboid also connects with the base of the fourth and fifth metatarsals (the metatarsals of the last two toes). On the inner side, it also connects with one of the lateral cuneiform bones.<br /><p><strong>Calcaneo-cuboid Joint</strong></p><br />The calcaneal-cuboid joint attaches the heel bone to the cuboid.<a></a><strong>Navicular</strong>The navicular is located in front of the talus and connects with it through the talo-navicular joint. The navicular is curved on the surface nearest the ankle. The side farthest from the ankle joint connects to each of the three cuneiform bones. Like the talus, the navicular has a poor blood supply. On the inner side (closest to the middle of the foot), there is a piece of bone that juts out, which is called the navicular tuberosity. This is the site where the posterior tibial tendon anchors into the bone.<a></a><strong>Talonavicular Joint</strong>As the name suggests, the talo-navicular joint connects the talus to the navicular. The curve of the navicular is designed to connect smoothly with the front surface of the talus. This joint allows for the potential to have significant motion between the hindfoot and the midfoot, depending on the position the hindfoot is in.<a></a><strong>Cuneiforms</strong>There are three different cuneiform bones present side-by-side in the midfoot. The one located on the inside of the midfoot is called the medial cuneiform. The middle cuneiform is located centrally in the midfoot, and to the outside is the lateral cuneiform. All three cuneiforms line up in a row and articulate with the navicular, forming the naviculo-cuneiform joint. The structure of the cuneiforms is similar to a roman arch. Each cuneiform connects to the others in order to form a more stable unit. These bones, along with the strong plantar and dorsal ligaments that connect to them, provide a good deal of stability for the midfoot.<br /><h2>Bones of the Fore-foot: Metatarsals (5), Phalanges (14), Sesmoid Bones (2)</h2><br /><a></a><strong>Metatarsals</strong>Each foot contains five metatarsals. These are the long bones that lead to the base of each toe. The metatarsals are numbered 1-5, starting on the inside and leading outward (from big toe to smallest). Each metatarsal is a long bone that joins with the mid-foot at its base, a joint called the tarsal-metatarsal joint, or Lisfranc joint. In general, the first three metatarsals are more rigidly held in place than the last two, although in some individuals there is increased motion associated with the 1st metatarsal where it joins the midfoot (at the 1st tarso-metatarsal joint), and this increased motion may predispose them to develop a bunion.The long part of the metatarsal bone is known as the metatarsal &quot;shaft&quot;, and the thick end of the bone nearest the toes is known as the metatarsal &quot;head&quot; (the metatarsal neck lies between the shaft and head). The head serves two very important functions:<br /><ul><br />	<li>First, the metatarsal heads are the locations where weightbearing takes place.</li><br />	<li>Second, the phalanges connect to the foot at the metatarsal heads at a joint called the metatarsal-phalangeal joint. These joints are very flexible, allowing the metatarsal heads to continuously support the weight of the body, as the foot moves from heel to toe.</li><br /></ul><br /><em>First Metatarsal</em> - The largest of the metatarsal, both in terms of length and width.<em>Second Metatarsal</em> - The fore-foot is made extremely stable not only by the ligaments connecting the bones, but also because the second metatarsal is recessed into the medial cuneiform, in comparison to the others. The second metatarsal may be overly long in some individuals, predisposing them to 2nd <em><strong><a href="/metatarsalgia" target="_blank">metatarsalgia</a></strong></em>.<em>Fourth and Fifth Metatarsal</em> - The fourth and fifth metatarsal may have greater range of motion than the others do.<a></a><strong>Phalanges</strong>The phalanges make up the bones of the toes. They are connected to the rest of the foot by the metatarsal-phalangeal joint. The first toe, also known as the great toe due to its relatively large size, is the only one to be comprised of only two phalanges. These are known as the proximal phalanx (closest to the ankle) and the distal phalanx (farthest from the ankle).The four &quot;lesser toes&quot; (toes 2-5) all have three phalanges. The phalanx closest to the ankle is known as the proximal phalanx, which articulates with the &quot;middle&quot; phalanx, the proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP joint). The middle phalanx meets the &quot;distal&quot; phalanx at the distal interphalangeal joint. An imbalance in the tendons pulling across these small joints of the toes will lead to deformity of the toe, such as a clawtoe. A list of the joints of the toes can be found below.<br /><ul><br />	<li>Inter-Phalangeal Joint (great toe only)</li><br />	<li>Proximal Inter-Phalangeal Joint (PIP joint - toes 2-5)</li><br />	<li>Distal Inter-Phalangeal Joint (DIP joint -toes 2-5)</li><br /></ul><br /><a></a><strong>Sesamoid Bones</strong>A sesamoid bone is a bone that is also part of a tendon. An easy example of such a bone is the kneecap (patella). In the foot, there are two sesamoid bones, each of which is located directly underneath the first metatarsal head.

During walking, the most energy efficient movement is one in which the body moves up and down very little.<br /><h3>Goal 3</h3><br />The third goal is to cause the least amount of pain for people with painful foot conditions.  Our brains have a variety of strategies for achieving this goal, including putting less pressure on a painful foot, or alternating the foot's position when we walk so as to limit discomfort.<br /><h3>Goal 4</h3><br />The fourth goal for walking is for the foot itself to act as a shock absorber for dispersing the force of the body as it lands.<br /><h3>Goal 5</h3><br />The fifth goal is for the foot to form a rigid lever toward the end of the phase of gait where the foot is on the ground, in order to provide a way to propel the body forward.<br /><h3><a name="The-Phases-of-Walking"></a></h3><br />One way to think about the phases of walking is to think of what happens to each foot when we walk.  In this situation, there are two phases: Stance phase and Swing phase (Figure 1).<br /><ol><br />	<li><em>Stance phase</em> is the time when the foot is on the ground.  It comprises about 60% of the walking cycle. For part of the stance phase, both feet will be on the ground for a period of time.</li><br />	<li><em>Swing Phase</em> occurs when one foot is on the ground and one in the air.  The foot that is in the air is said to be in the &quot;Swing&quot; phase of gait.</li><br /></ol><br /><h5>Figure 1: Phases of Gait</h5><br />[Content: /wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Figure-1-Phases-of-Gait_thumb_thumb.jpg Goes Here]<br /><h3><a name="Foot-on-the-Ground"></a></h3><br />A more convenient and precise way to think about the stance phase (foot on the ground) of walking is to consider the five sub-stages that a single foot undergoes (Figure 1). They are as follows: Heel strike, Early flatfoot, Late flatfoot, Heel rise, and Toe off.<br /><h3>Heel Strike</h3><br />The heel strike phase starts the moment when the heel first touches the ground, and lasts until the whole foot is on the ground (early flatfoot stage).<br /><h3>Early flatfoot</h3><br />The beginning of the &quot;early flatfoot&quot; stage is defined as the moment that the whole foot is on the ground. The end of the &quot;early flatfoot&quot; stage occurs when the body's center of gravity passes over top of the foot. The body's center of gravity is located approximately in the pelvic area in front of the lower spine, when we stand and walk.  The main purpose of the &quot;early flatfoot&quot; stage is to allow the foot to serve as a shock absorber, helping to cushion the force of the body weight landing on the foot.<br /><h3>Late flatfoot</h3><br />Once the body's center of gravity has passed in front of the neutral position, a person is said to be in the late flatfoot stage.  The &quot;late flatfoot&quot; stage of gait ends when the heel lifts off the ground.  During the &quot;late flatfoot&quot; phase gait, the foot needs to go from being a flexible shock absorber to being a rigid lever that can serve to propel the body forward.<br /><h3>Heel rise</h3><br />As the name suggests, the heel rise phase begins when the heel begins to leave the ground. During this phase, the foot functions as a rigid lever to move the body forward. During this phase of walking, the forces that go through the foot are quite significant: often 2-3x a person's body weight.  This is because the foot creates a lever arm (centered on the ankle), which serves to magnify body weight forces.  Given these high forces and considering that the average human takes 3000-5000 steps per day (an active person commonly takes 10,000 steps/day), it is not surprising that the foot can easily develop chronic repetitive stress related problems, such as <em><strong><a href="/metatarsalgia">metatarsalgia</a></strong></em>, <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/bunions-hallux-valgus">bunions</a></strong></em>, <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/acquired-adult-flatfoot-deformity-posterior-tibial-tendon-dysfunction">posterior tibial tendon dysfunction</a></strong></em>, <em><strong><a href="/peroneal-tendonitis">peroneal tendonitis</a></strong></em>, and <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/sesamoiditis">seasmoiditis</a></strong></em>.<br /><h3>Toe off</h3><br />The toe off stage of gait begins as the toes leave the ground.  This represents the start of the swing phase.<br /><h3><a name="Running"></a></h3><br />The defining difference between walking and running is that during running, there is a period of time when both feet are off the ground (the &quot;float&quot; phase).  Also because running is associated with greater speeds, the forces that go through the foot when it lands can be substantially greater than during walking (often 4-5x body weight during running and even up to 6-7x body weight during sprinting).<br /><h3><a name="The-Movement-of-Major-Joints-in-the-Foot-during-walking"></a></h3><br />There are a number of joints in the foot and ankle that move during walking. However, two &quot;joints&quot; serve critical functions during normal walking.  These two joints are the ankle joint and the transverse tarsal joint (Figure 2). In fact, the transverse tarsal joint is not a single joint but rather the combination of the talo-navicular and the calcaneo-cuboid joint.<br /><h5>Figure 2: Ankle and Transverse Tarsal Joints</h5><br />[Content: /wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Main-Joints-that-Move-during-Gait_thumb.jpg Goes Here]<br /><h3>Ankle Joint</h3><br />This joint allows the foot to move up (dorsiflexion) and down (plantarflexion), using the muscles located in the front of the leg (the anterior muscle compartment) for upward movement, and the muscles located in the back of the leg (the posterior compartment) to pull the foot back down.<br /><h3>Transverse Tarsal Joint</h3><br />This joint is composed of the talo-navicular and calcaneal cuboid joint. The transverse tarsal joint also relies on normal function of the subtalar joint, in order to move normally.  Along with the subtalar joint, it allows the foot to have some side to side motion and thereby accommodate uneven terrain.  Because the transverse tarsal joint is made of two joints, the transverse tarsal joint can be either loose and floppy (early flatfoot stage) or rigid (late flatfoot and heel rise) at certain points in the walking cycle.  The transverse tarsal joint is floppy when the joint axes of the two joints involved are parallel to each other (early flatfoot stage). When the two joint axes are not parallel, the transverse tarsal joint becomes rigid and prevents movement through the joint (late flatfoot and heel rise). The locking and unlocking of this joint is very important to a normal gait cycle.  When the heel hits the ground, the ankle joint is lowered gently onto the ground and the transverse tarsal joint is locked. During early flatfoot, the transverse tarsal joint unlocks, allowing the foot to become floppy and allowing movement through this joint. This action allows the foot to serve as a shock absorber. As the center of gravity passes over the neutral position, the posterior tibial tendon pulls on this joint and locks it, once again creating a rigid lever. This way, when the heel rises off the ground, the calf can channel force into the ground to propel the body forward.<br /><h3><a name="How-the-Muscles-Work-During-Walking"></a></h3><br /><h3>Heel Strike-Early Flatfoot</h3><br />The anterior compartment is most active, which means that the tibialis anterior muscle, the extensor hallicus longus, and the extensor digitorum longus work to gently lower the foot onto the ground. If these muscles do not work, such as would be the case in someone with a <em><strong><a href="/drop-foot">drop foot</a></strong></em>, the foot will tend to slap onto the ground when it lands.<br /><h3>Late Flatfoot-Heel Rise</h3><br />As the body's center of gravity passes over the foot, the posterior compartment muscles begin to contract. This contraction of the calf muscle serves to control the body movement as it goes forward, so that the body does not fall forward.  During this phase of gait (late flatfoot), the calf muscle is strongly contracting and lengthening.  This is called an &quot;eccentric&quot; muscle contraction, and it serves to generate an extraordinary amount of internal force within the calf muscle and Achilles tendon.  This is why most <em><strong><a href="/achilles-tendon-rupture">Achilles tendon ruptures</a></strong></em> and <em><strong><a href="/calf-muscle-tear-gastrocnemius-tear">calf tears</a></strong></em> occur during this stage gait.<br /><h3>Heel Rise-Toe Off</h3><br />During the heel rise phase, the calf muscle continues to contract, but is now shortening rather than lengthening (performing a concentric contracture). This lasts until the toe off phase.<br /><h3><a name="Abnormal-Gait-Patterns"></a></h3><br /><h3>Antalgic Gait (painful walking)</h3><br />The primary sign of an antalgic or painful gait is the reduced amount of time spent in the stance phase. This is because people do not want to spend any more time than necessary on a foot that is causing them pain. While the stance phase is usually divided equally between the two legs, someone with a painful foot will spend substantially less time on the injured foot, perhaps only 20-30% of their gait rather than 50%. Another sign of painful gait is a decreased stride length, which results from patients not wanting to push off from their painful foot as powerfully as normal. Therefore, one stride tends to be much longer than the other.<br /><h3>High Steppage Gait</h3><br />Another example of an abnormal gait is a high-steppage gait pattern. This form of walking is seen in patients whose anterior compartment muscles do not function normally (ex. Patients with a <em><strong><a href="/drop-foot">drop foot</a></strong></em>). This lack of anterior muscle compartment functioning causes the foot to slap onto the ground during the heel strike phase of walking.  Patients normally respond to this problem by bending their knee more than normal during the swing phase of gait (the time when the foot is off the ground) to lift the foot higher off the ground. One type of treatment for this type of gait abnormality is to fit the patient with an <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-foot-orthosis-afo">AFO (Ankle Foot Orthosis)</a></strong></em>, which is a rigid brace that keeps the foot locked in a 90 degree angle.<br /><p>Edited July 16th, 2015</p>
Equinus contractures are the inability to bring the foot up to a neutral position (a right angle to the lower leg) due to either tightness of the muscles and/or tendons in the calf, scarring of the ankle joint capsule and other restraining structures, or a bone spur at the front of the ankle that restricts normal ankle motion.  It is named after horses (equine) who essentially walk &quot;on their toes.&quot;A gastrocnemius equinus contracture (Figure 1) occurs when tightness in the outer calf muscle (gastrocnemius) leads to limited ankle dorsiflexion (motion through the ankle joint itself).  To compensate for this tightness and allow the foot to settle on the ground, compensatory motion will often occur in the joint in front of the ankle, the transverse tarsal joint, which is made up of the talonavicular joint and the calcaneal-cuboid joints (Figure 2).  The hallmark of a gastrocnemius equinus contracture is that it will correct (i.e ankle motion will become full) when the knee is bent because the pressure is taken off the gastrocnemius muscle, since it attaches above the knee joint.<br /><h5>Figure 1: Limited motion through the ankle joint</h5><br />[Content: /wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Equinus-contracture-illustrated-resized.jpg Goes Here]<br /><h5>Figure 2: Compensatory motion through the joints in front of the ankle joint</h5><br />[Content: /wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Equinus-Compensate-Illustrated-resized2.jpg Goes Here]<br /><p>Edited September 5, 2015</p>
The human foot has an interesting evolutionary history. Understanding this history can be helpful in assessing foot and ankle problems, because there is a theory that many humans have retained some elements of foot characteristics of our evolutionary ancestors (atavistic traits).  These traits may lead to conditions such as <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/characteristics-of-flat-foot">flatfeet</a></strong></em> and <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/bunions-hallux-valgus">bunions</a></strong></em>, which alter the way that the foot absorbs force when we walk.  This in turn can lead to a propensity to develop symptomatic foot conditions (ex. <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/metatarsalgia">metatarsalgia</a></strong></em>, <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/acquired-adult-flatfoot-deformity-posterior-tibial-tendon-dysfunction">acquired adult flatfoot deformity</a></strong></em>, <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/bunions-hallux-valgus">bunions</a></strong></em>, <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/plantar-fasciitis">plantar fasciitis</a></strong></em>, etc).  This theory seems to be initially proposed by Dudley Morton (different from the Morton who described Morton's neuroma).  Morton was an anatomist at Columbia University who wrote a book entitled <em>The Human Foot: Its Evolutionary Development, Physiology and Functional Disorders</em> in 1935.Here are some ideas associated with the role of the importance the evolution of the human foot:<br /><h3>1. Humans are one of the &quot;Great Apes&quot;</h3><br />Along with Chimpanzees, Pygmy Chimps (Bonobos), Gorillas, and Orangutans.  From a genetic point of view, humans are closely related to the other great apes sharing over over 95% of our DNA. Chimpanzees share 97.3% of their DNA with humans.  From a genetic point of view, it has been suggested that chimpanzees are more closely related to humans than they are to gorillas.<br /><h3>2. The other great apes all have opposable first rays i.e. they can grab things with their feet (Figure 1)</h3><br /><h5>Figure 1: Baby Gorilla using feet to grab</h5><br />[Content: /wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Gorilla-Climbing-resized.jpg Goes Here]<br /><h3>3. Chimps, Gorillas, and Orangutans all have pronounced <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/equinus-contractures">gastrocnemius equinus contractures</a></strong></em>.</h3><br />When you straighten their knees, their feet point down and they are unable to bring their feet up to a right angle unless they bend their knees.  This occurs because the outer calf muscle (the gastrocnemius) starts above the knee and is therefore under tension when the knee is straight.  This anatomical setup explains why the other great apes always walk with their knees bent.<br /><p>Edited September 5, 2015</p>
<a href="http://youtu.be/m307IHEz27g" target="_blank">Click here to view a video on Foot Types</a>While the bones, tendons, and joints have little variation, the way these structures interact with one another can result in a variety of different foot types. These foot types follow a basic spectrum that ranges from a flatfoot on one end, to a high arched foot on the other (Figure 1).<br /><h5>Figure 1: The spectrum of foot shapes</h5><br />[Content: /wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Figure-1-Foot-Type-Spectrum.jpg Goes Here]All foot types within this spectrum are considered normal. However, people with certain foot types are prone to develop certain corresponding symptoms or conditions. For example, people with flatfeet tend to develop <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/acquired-adult-flatfoot-deformity-posterior-tibial-tendon-dysfunction">posterior tibial tendonitis</a></strong></em> (irritation of the tendon on the inside of the ankle), and people with high arched feet tend to develop <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/peroneal-tendonitis">peroneal tendonitis</a></strong></em> (irritation of the tendons on the outside of the ankle). The reason is that a person's foot type dictates how the forces are transmitted through the foot. Most chronic foot conditions (ex. Tendonitis) are related to the way the foot absorbs force repetitively with each step. Therefore by determining a person's foot type, a doctor can quickly and easily get an idea of possible conditions that might be the cause of a patients discomfort (see Table 1).<br /><h5>Table 1: Conditions associated with common foot types</h5><br /><table><br /><tbody><br /><tr><br /><th>FLATFEET <em>predispose to the following conditions:</em></th><br /><th>HIGH ARCHED FEET<em> predispose to the following conditions:</em></th><br /></tr><br /><tr><br /><td><em><strong><a href="/acquired-adult-flatfoot-deformity-posterior-tibial-tendon-dysfunction">Acquired Adult Flatfoot deformity (Posterior Tibial Tendonitis)</a></strong></em></td><br /><td><em><strong><a href="/peroneal-tendonitis">Peroneal Tendonitis</a></strong></em></td><br /></tr><br /><tr><br /><td><em><strong><a href="/plantar-fasciitis">Plantar Fasciitis</a></strong></em></td><br /><td><em><strong><a href="/ankle-instability">Ankle Instability</a></strong></em></td><br /></tr><br /><tr><br /><td><em><strong><a href="/tarsal-tunnel-syndrome">Tarsal Tunnel Syndrome</a></strong></em></td><br /><td><em><strong><a href="/sprained-ankle">Ankle Sprains</a></strong></em></td><br /></tr><br /><tr><br /><td><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/2nd-metatarsal-stress-fractures-or-march-fracture" target="_blank"><em><strong>2nd metatarsal stress fractures</strong></em></a></td><br /><td><em><strong><a href="/jones-fracture-5th-metatarsal-stress-fracture">Jones fractures (5th Metatarsal stress fractures)</a></strong></em></td><br /></tr><br /><tr><br /><td></td><br /><td><em><strong><a href="/sesamoiditis">Sesamoiditis</a></strong></em></td><br /></tr><br /></tbody><br /></table><br /><h3>How to tell what your foot type is</h3><br />In general, the easiest way to determine your basic foot type is to note the kind of imprint your foot makes when you step onto a soft surface. If the entire foot or the majority of the foot is showing, this indicates a flat foot (Figure 2). On the other hand, if only the heel and ball of the foot are showing, with very little imprint in the middle portion of the foot, this indicates a high arch foot (Figure 2). In the doctor's office, a tool known as a Harris Mat can be used to determine loading pattern and therefore foot type.<br /><h5>Figure 2: Imprints from a flatfoot and a high arched foot</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Foot-Type-Harris-Mat.png">^media_display_589c2930de9125bcb7692f90/position:center^</a>A simple foot type test at home: If you would like to get an idea of your foot type while still at home, you can imitate a Harris Mat using a bit of water and a paper towel. Simply wet your foot with a small amount of water (don't soak your foot too much) and briefly step onto the paper towel. The imprint left by the water should provide a nice picture of where weight is distributed on your foot<em><strong><a href="/characteristics-of-flat-foot">Characteristics of a Flat Foot</a></strong></em><br /><em><strong><a href="/characteristics-of-high-arched-foot-subtle-cavus">Characteristics of a High Arch Foot</a></strong></em><br /><p>Edited September 10th, 2015</p>
Approximately 30 percent of the population have a moderately to extremely flat foot type. As the name suggests, a flat foot is one where nearly all of the sole of the foot is touching the ground during standing. Flatfooted people have feet with the following characteristics:<br /><ul><br />	<li>Heel points outward from the ankle (valgus heel)</li><br />	<li>Floppier and suppler foot due to an excess of movement in the midfoot region.</li><br /></ul><br />There are two primary reasons why someone would have a flatfoot.<br /><h3>1. Medial Column Hypermobility</h3><br />(Figure 1)<br />In some individuals the inner part of the foot (the &quot;medial column&quot;) has too much motion. The medial column is essentially the inside part of the foot - all the structures in the foot that line up with the big toe. When the medial column is floppy the base of the great toe fails to take its share of the weight during gait, allowing the arch of the foot to collapse.<br /><h5>Figure 1: Medial Column Hypermobility</h5><br />[Content: /wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Figure-1-Stable-and-Unstable-Medial-Column.jpg Goes Here]<br /><h3>2. A Tight Calf Muscle (<em><strong><a href="/equinus-contractures">Gastrocnemius Equinus Contracture</a></strong></em>)</h3><br />The second major cause of a flat foot is a very tight and inflexible calf muscle. In this case, the foot will flex up through the ankle joint (dorsiflexion) toward the person and quickly meet resistance from the tight calf muscle. If the ankle joint does not allow for adequate upward flexing (dorsiflexion) due to a tight calf muscle then the foot rotates upward around the joint in front of the ankle (the talonavicular joint). However, the talo-navicular joint not only moves up and down, it also moves to the outside. This rotates the front part of the foot to the outside (abduction) causing the arch to collapse inwards. A tight calf muscle (usually hereditary) is a fairly common cause of flat foot. <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/flexible-flatfeet">Pediatric flatfoot</a></strong></em> (flexible flatfoot in a child) is almost always associated with a very tight calf muscle. This condition is often asymptomatic but sometimes worrying to parents.These two causes of a flat foot deformity are often related and both seem related to the evolution of the foot. This explains why many people with flatfeet also have a parent or grandparent with flatfeet.<br /><h2>Flat Foot Symptoms:</h2><br />During walking, there is two to three times the weight of the body going through the foot. This force can take the form of jamming (compression) forces, which act through the joints, or a pulling (traction) forces, which act on ligaments and tendons (Figure 2). Because there is so much movement in the medial column with flatfooted people, all the tendons on the inside of the ankle (especially the posterior tibial tendon) have to work extra hard to pull the foot into the shape of a rigid lever prior to the foot pushing off the ground during gait.<br /><h5>Figure 2: Traction and Compression Forces in a Flatfoot Deformity</h5><br />[Content: /wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Figure-2A-Traction-Forces-Flatfoot-300x223.jpg Goes Here][Content: /wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Figure-2B-Compression-forces-Flatfoot-180x300.jpg Goes Here]As a result of the exaggerated traction forces acting on the inside of the ankle, flatfooted people are much more likely to develop problems related to repetitive overload of the structures on the inside of the ankle and arch. These problems include: <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/acquired-adult-flatfoot-deformity-posterior-tibial-tendon-dysfunction">posterior tibialis tendonitis</a></strong></em> (acquired adult flatfoot deformity), <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/tarsal-tunnel-syndrome">tarsal tunnel syndrome</a></strong></em>, and <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/plantar-fasciitis">plantar fasciatis</a></strong></em> (a list commonly known as the terrible triad).The compression forces associated with a flat foot go through the outside of the ankle joint. These forces can actually squash the outside of the ankle to such a degree that it may eventually wear out the outside of the ankle joint leading to <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-arthritis">ankle arthritis</a></strong></em>. In the same way there is also often painful compression in the outside front part of the subtalar joint (the joint below the ankle joint) leading to a condition that is commonly called sinus tarsi syndrome.In addition, it is also common for flatfooted people to experience repetitive overload of the bases of the second toe because the base of the great toe does not take its share of the weight during each step. This &quot;transfers&quot; the force to the base of the second toe potentially leading to <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/metatarsalgia">overload metatarsalgia</a></strong></em> or even a <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/2nd-metatarsal-stress-fractures-or-march-fracture"><em><strong>second metatarsal stress fracture</strong></em></a>.<br /><p>Edited July 10th, 2014</p>
A high arch foot is known in medical terms as a &quot;subtle cavus foot&quot;. People with high arch feet tend to be very stiff through the midfoot, with very little movement through the main midfoot joints (ex. the talo-navicular joint). The heel tends to be pointed inward in what is known as a varus position (Figure 1a). This foot position can be easily identified on examination by looking at the feet head on with the patient standing. If the inside edge of the heel is visible from the front (this is known as a peek-a-boo heel), then the individual likely has an inwardly pointed heel (varus heel) (Figure 1b).<br /><h5>Figure 1a, 1b, 1c: Hindfoot Varus, Peek-a-Boo Heel Sign, and High Arched Foot Imprint (Harris Mat)</h5><br />[Content: /wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Figure-1B-Hindfoot-Varus-300x251.jpg Goes Here][Content: /wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Figure-1A-Peek-a-Boo-Heel-Sign1-300x277.jpg Goes Here][Content: /wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Figure-1C-High-Arched-Foot-Harris-Mat.jpg Goes Here]Unlike in a flatfoot the medial column of a high arch foot is not loose and floppy. Instead it is quite rigid and often pointed downward (plantar flexed). This part of the foot acts &quot;like a kickstand&quot; to tip the heel in an inward (varus) position. This causes the base of the great toe to take a great deal of force, which can be the cause of a number of problems including <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/sesamoiditis">sesamoiditis</a></strong></em> and <em><strong>sesamoid stress fractures</strong></em>.<br /><h3>High Arch Foot Symptoms</h3><br />A high arched foot predisposes an individual to a variety of symptoms because of the manner in which this type of foot absorbs force. The excess loading on the base of the big toe can predispose people to develop <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/sesamoiditis">sesamoiditis</a></strong></em> and <em><strong>sesamoid fractures</strong></em>. Traction forces lead to repetitive loading of the tendons on the outside of the foot and therefore predispose patients to develop <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/peroneal-tendonitis">peroneal tendonitis</a></strong></em>. Compression forces are increased on the inside of the ankle, which makes damage to the inside (medial) aspect of the ankle joint more common potentially leading to <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/osteochondral-lesions-of-talus-olt-talar-ocds-talar-ocls/">talar osteochondral injuries</a></strong></em> or even <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-arthritis">ankle arthritis</a></strong></em>. The structure and loading patterns of a high arch foot also make it more susceptible to: <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/sprained-ankle">ankle sprains</a></strong></em>; fractures on the outside of the fifth metatarsal (<em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/jones-fracture-5th-metatarsal-stress-fracture">Jones fractures</a></strong></em>); and pain directly under the great toe (<em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/sesamoiditis">sesamoiditis</a></strong></em>).<br /><p>Edited July 10th, 2014</p>

This means that this material will mold to the shape it is exposed to. For this reason, Plastazote has many uses, such as arch supports (particularly in diabetics), lining braces, and inserts for amputee limbs.<strong>Podagra</strong>: Another older term for <em><strong><a href="/gout">Gout</a></strong></em>.<strong>Pre-hallax Syndrome</strong>: Also called Accessory Navicular Syndrome. An unusual extra bony extension of the navicular bone. An accessory navicular can cause pain at the fibrous interface between the extra bone and the navicular bone. A condition that commonly presents in adolescents with an accessory navicular. Alternatively, symptoms can occur due to the prominence of the bone on the inside of the foot.<strong>Pronation</strong>: Turning out of the hindfoot. It is often associated with a flat foot. A certain amount of pronation during the stance phase is good, as it helps absorb shock during walking or running. However, too much pronation can tend to overload the tendons and soft-tissues on the inside of the ankle, potentially leading to conditions such as <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/acquired-adult-flatfoot-deformity-posterior-tibial-tendon-dysfunction">posterior tibial tendonitis</a></strong></em>.<em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/proprioception-exercises"><strong>Proprioceptive Sense</strong></a></em>: The bio-feedback from the extremities, which tells the brain where and in what position the body is in. Propriception is critical in balance. The proprioception of a joint, such as the ankle, can be significantly diminished following surgery or following an injury such as an ankle sprain. Therefore, proprioception training should be an important part of rehabilitation following an injury.<strong>Prosthesis</strong>: Device which replaces or substitutes a body part.<strong>Psoriatic Arthritis</strong>: Arthritis accompanied by an abnormal skin condition. It is characterized by an abnormally exuberant immune reaction to the lining of a joint(s).<a name="Q"></a><strong>Quadriplegic</strong>: Paralysis of both arms and legs.<a name="R"></a><strong>Reiter's Syndrome</strong>: Arthritis accompanied classically by urethritis (inflammation and irritation of the ureathra) and conjunctivitis (inflammation of the eyes).<strong>Resection Arthroplasty</strong>: Surgical procedure which removes part of a bone on one or both sides of a joint.<strong>Rheumatism</strong>: A non-specific term for general joint pain.<em><a href="/rheumatoid-arthritis"><strong>Rheumatoid Arthritis</strong></a></em>: Swelling, discomfort, and stiffness of the joints and tendons, often beginning in the feet. This may be accompanied by the formation of rheumatoid nodules in the soft-tissues.<strong>Rickets</strong>: Abnormality of calcium or phosphorus metabolism in infants' or children's growing bones. Most often due to insufficient vitamin D.<a name="S"></a><strong>Sensory Nerves</strong>: Nerves which transmit pain, temperature changes, touch, etc.<strong>Sesamoids</strong>: A bone which is enveloped within a tendon, as in the two bones under the first metatarsal bone.<strong>Shin Splints</strong>: Leg pain around the shin bone (tibia) occurring after a period of activity. It has been proposed that the pain may be caused either by inflammation at the site where the lower leg muscles attach to the bone (periosteitis), or by mild compartment syndrome.<strong>Splay Foot</strong>: Abnormally wide foot.<strong>Sprain</strong>: an injury to the ligaments holding a joint together. For example, an <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/sprained-ankle" target="_blank">Ankle Sprain</a></strong></em> is an injury to the ligament(s) stabilizing the outside of the ankle joint.<strong>Strain</strong>: an injury to the muscle tissue itself, either as a result of a single acute injury (ex. Calf strain) or as a result of multiple microscopic injuries.<strong>Supination</strong>: An inward turning of the foot. The opposite of pronation. It is common in people with high arched feet (subtle cavus foot). A supinated foot is often a stiffer foot than a flatfoot.<strong>Synovitis</strong>: Inflammation of the synovium, which is the innermost lining of the joint. The synovium is responsible for secreting synovial fluid, the fluid that normally lubricates the joint. The synovium is normally a very thin sheet of tissue (only a few cell layers thick) however, when it becomes inflamed it can get quite thick and secrete excessive joint fluid. Conditions such as <em><strong><a href="/rheumatoid-arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</a></strong></em> and Psoriatic arthritis are characterized by synovitis.<a name="T"></a><strong>Talus</strong>: The talus is the main bone that helps connect the lower leg to the foot. The talus is one of the major bones helping to form the ankle joint. It is the lower bone of the ankle joint, and articulates with the end of the tibia (directly above it) and the fibula (above and to the outside). The talus has an unusual shape, and is almost 70% covered with articular cartilage. It has many tendons running past it, but no tendons attaching. It also has a notoriously poor blood supply, which leaves it vulnerable to avascular necrosis (AVN) when a significant talar fracture has occurred.<strong>Talpes Equinovarus</strong>: Also called &quot;<em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/clubfoot-deformity-talipes-equinovarus">Clubfoot</a></strong></em>&quot;. It is a congenital condition where the soles of a newborn face each other rather than each other.<em><a href="/tarsal-coalition"><strong>Tarsal Coalition</strong></a></em>: An abnormal connection of bones of the hindfoot by cartilage tissue or by bony bridges.

One technique for rehab for the Achilles tendon rupture is aggressive athletic rehab. This process is focused on faster mobilization following an Achilles tendon rupture repair. Once the wound is healed, patients are encouraged to actively move their ankle through a series of exercises designed to fire the calf muscle and to use the Achilles, but doing so in such a way without putting a significant amount of force through the Achilles. Patients still have to significantly limit their activity, but rather than using a cast, patients are using a boot. This program, however, has potential advantages and disadvantages:<br /><h2>Advantages</h2><br /><ul><br />	<li>Faster recovery</li><br />	<li>Less calf strength is lost</li><br />	<li>Less leg strength is lost</li><br /></ul><br /><h2>Disadvantages</h2><br /><ul><br />	<li>Risk of stretching out the repaired Achilles. The elongated Achilles will be weak and a revision surgery may be necessary.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>Edited September 10th, 2015</p>
<h2>Indications: who should do calf stretches?</h2><br />Calf stretching is standard treatment for plantar fasciitis and any other condition associated with a tight calf muscle or Achilles tendon. The calf muscle tends to stiffen as a person ages or after the lower leg has been immobilized for any length of time.<br /><h2>How it's done</h2><br />Lean forward with your hands on the wall.  Place the leg to be stretched back and keep the knee straight.  Turn your foot inwards so that you feel the stretch in your calf, and not on the inside of your ankle.A typical calf stretching routine would involve stretching for a total of 5 or more minutes each day. For example, 30 seconds a side and then alternate for a total of 5 minutes (2.5 minutes each side).  Calf stretching needs to be performed regularly (ex. daily) for a minimum of 4-6 weeks before any significant effect will be noted.[Content: /wp-content/uploads/2010/08/calf-stretching_thumb.jpg Goes Here]<br /><p>Edited September 10th, 2015</p>
<h2>Indications: who should do double leg heel rises?</h2><br />Double leg heel rises are performed to strengthen the calf muscles.  These muscles are often weak following immobilization after surgery or injury.  Injuries, such as Achilles tendon ruptures and Ankle fractures, often require a concerted effort at calf stretching during the recovery period.  In addition, this exercise can strengthen the tibialis posterior (posterior tibial tendon) muscle, which is often weak and dysfunctional in patients with acquired adult flatfoot deformity.<br /><h2>How it's done</h2><br />Use your calf muscles to slowly raise both your heels off of the floor, then slowly bring your heels back to the ground and repeat again.  If one leg is weaker or recovering from injury, then take the majority (70-80%) of the body weight on the uninjured side.Perform the double leg heel rise exercises every second day (3-4 times per week). Start with a low number of repetitions (ex. 5-10) and sets (3-5), and gradually work up until you are doing many repetitions (20-30) and many sets (10-12).  It can take many months to work up to doing a large number of repetitions.  The calf muscle can be slow to regain strength, often requiring many months to regain most lost strength.Some patients may benefit from performing calf raises with their heels hanging off the edge of a rung of stairs.  This works the calf muscle over a longer excursion.  This may be beneficial in certain conditions such as Achilles tendonitis[Content: /wp-content/uploads/2010/08/P9200048_thumb_thumb-1024x768.jpg Goes Here][Content: /wp-content/uploads/2010/08/P9200049_thumb_thumb-1024x768.jpg Goes Here]<br /><p>Edited September 10th, 2015</p>
<h2>Indications: who should do figure of eight exercises?</h2><br />Anyone who is attempting to regain hindfoot motion may benefit from figure of eight exercises. This would include patients who are trying to regain movement after being immobilized, following surgery or an injury. The hindfoot is comprised of a number of joints (ankle, subtalar, talonavicular, and calcaneocuboid joints) that allow the foot to move in a way that enables it to accommodate uneven terrain, when standing and walking.  The figure of eight exercises will help regain this important motion.<br /><h2>How it's done</h2><br />Imagine that the tip of your big toe is a pen, then &quot;draw&quot; a figure of eight with your big toe.  Move slowly and repeat this motion for 30-60 seconds.  Take a break, and then repeat this exercise 5-10 times for a total of 5-10 minutes per day. Don't be discouraged if your motion is limited compared to the opposite foot.  It often takes time to get this motion back. Be sure not to do anything that creates excessive discomfort.<br /><p>Edited September 10th, 2015</p>
<h2>Indications: who should do &quot;Heel-to-Heel&quot; inversions?</h2><br />Patients with painful and dysfunctional posterior tibial tendons will often benefit from a heel-to-heel inversions exercise. This situation is often encountered in patients with acquired adult flatfoot deformities. This exercise is performed against minimal resistance (gravity) so it can often be performed numerous times, allowing for a slow build up in strength and function of the irritated tendon.<br /><h2>How it's done</h2><br />Sit on a high stool so that the balls of your feet are barely touching the floor. Imagine two points on the soles of your feet: one under the base of your big toe and the second at the base of the small toe.<br /><ol><br />	<li>Keep your heels on the ground and move the first point under the big toe as far apart from each other as possible, without lifting your heels off the ground.  (Figure #1)</li><br />	<li>Then move the second point on both feet as close together as possible by curling the feet inwards (Figure #2)</li><br /></ol><br />Start by performing 10 repetitions and then take a 10-15 second break, then repeat this 5-10 times. Gradually work up the number of repetitions and sets that you perform until you can comfortably perform 12 sets of 25 repetitions.<br /><p>Edited September 10th, 2015</p>

<em>There is no operation that has ever been invented that does not have the potential to make a patient worse.</em>Surgery has the potential to improve the lives of many patients. However, there are inherent risks that are involved with ANY surgical procedure.  For patient contemplating surgery, it is important to discuss with your physician what outcome you can reasonably expect as a result of your surgery.  It is also essential to understand the risks and potential surgical complications associated with your particular procedure.<em><strong><a href="#asymmetric-gait">Asymmetric Gait (leading to pain elsewhere)</a></strong></em><em><strong><a href="#crps">Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS)</a></strong></em><em><strong><a href="#dvt">Deep Vein Thrombosis / DVT (Blood Clot)</a></strong></em><em><strong><a href="#continued-pain">Failure to Resolve ALL Symptoms</a></strong></em><em><strong><a href="#infection">Infection</a></strong></em><em><strong><a href="#nerve-injury">Nerve Injury / Neuritis</a></strong></em><em><strong><a href="#non-union">Delayed Union / Non-Union</a></strong></em><em><strong><a href="#pe">Pulmonary Embolism (PE)</a></strong></em><em><strong><a href="#vascular-injury">Vascular Injury</a></strong></em><em><strong><a href="#wound-healing-problems">Wound Healing Problems</a></strong></em><hr /><h3><a name="asymmetric-gait"></a>Asymmetric Gait</h3><br />While recovering from foot surgery, patients invariably walk with an asymmetric gait that will cause disproportional loading in other parts of the body (most often the back and occasionally the hip or knee on the opposite side). This compensation in gait may lead to irritation to tendons, muscles, and ligaments, which can become painful. The symptoms associated with an asymmetric gait are usually self limiting after the gait has normalized. Symptoms that result from an asymmetric gait can be helped by focused stretching and core strengthening during the recovery time.  In addition, patients should consider using <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/crutches">crutches</a></strong></em>, a <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/canes">cane</a></strong></em>, or a <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/knee-walker">knee walker</a></strong></em> rather than walk with a markedly asymmetric gait.<br /><h2><a name="crps"></a>Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS)</h2><br /><h4>Summary</h4><br />Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) is a serious post-operative complication characterized by marked pain, and often out of proportion to the clinical findings.  In the past, it was known as Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (RSD).  Fortunately CRPS is a relatively uncommon complication.  However, when CRPS does occur, it can create significant ongoing extremity pain and symptoms which need to be treated early and aggressively, in order to minimize the potential for long-term problems.<br /><h4>Clinical Presentation</h4><br />Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) is a neurological syndrome characterized by:<br /><ul><br />	<li>Severe burning pain</li><br />	<li>Pathological changes in bone (often a washing out of calcium from the bone)</li><br />	<li>Pathological skin changes (such as dramatic color changes)</li><br />	<li>Excessive sweating</li><br />	<li>Tissue swelling</li><br />	<li>Extreme sensitivity to touch (difficulty having even bedsheets touch the involved area is a common finding)</li><br /></ul><br /><em>CRPS is best described in terms of an injury to a nerve, soft tissue or bone (e.g. a fracture) that does not follow the normal healing path</em>.  When CRPS occurs, the sympathetic nervous system seems to assume an abnormal hyper-excited state after an injury.  The sympathetic nervous system is the part of the nervous system that is involved in the &quot;fight or flight&quot; response.  It provides a &quot;control&quot; function for the organs and tissues of the body.  For example, it helps control the diameter of blood vessels (and by extension how much blood is flowing to each area of the body).CRPS development does not appear to depend on the magnitude of the injury.  Relatively minor injuries can lead to CRPS and severe injuries often do not create any abnormal sympathetic response. There is no single laboratory test to diagnose CRPS.  Therefore, the physician must assess and document both subjective complaints (medical history) and, if present, objective findings (physical examination) before arriving at a diagnosis.  Because CRPS is a serious condition, making such a diagnosis should not be done without serious consideration and significant expertise on the part of the physician.  Therefore, a diagnosis of true CRPS is often best left to a physician with extensive experience (often a pain medicine specialist).CRPS will often start as a localized <em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#nerve-injury">nerve injury (neuritis)</a></strong></em>.  In CRPS, all of the nerves innervating the foot tend to become excessively &quot;excited.&quot;  This is not only painful, but also creates a marked increase in blood flow to the foot as the sympathetic nerves cause the blood vessels to dilate.  This can produce impressive blanching of the skin when it is touched (Figure 1).  This blood flow leads to swelling and warmth in the foot, as well as the tendency to resorb the calcium in the bone leading to excessive local loss of bone mass (osteopenia).  It is also the reason why a bone scan will show an intense &quot;lighting up&quot; in the foot of a patient with CRPS, as this is consistent with the marked increase in local blood flow.<br /><h5>Figure 1: Blanching of the skin from dilated blood vessels (Dermatographia)</h5><br />[Content: /wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Dermatographia_thumb_thumb.jpg Goes Here]<br /><h3>Treatment</h3><br />Treatment of CRPS needs to be started early and should be aggressive.  If a significant local <em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#nerve-injury">nerve injury (neuritis)</a></strong></em> or a complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is diagnosed, a referral to a pain medicine specialist may be warranted.  Treatment may involve:<br /><ul><br />	<li><em>Physical therapy aimed at addressing a local neuritis (nerve irritation): </em>This can include &quot;desensitization therapy&quot; where the area around the <em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#nerve-injury">injured nerve</a></strong></em> is massaged. This can be uncomfortable.  It is often counterintuitive as it can make the symptoms worse in the short-term, yet it is essential to get the nerve to settle down.  In addition, physical therapists will continue to work on maintaining joint motion.</li><br />	<li><em>Nerve stabilizing medication: </em>Medications such as gabapentin (Neurontin) may be started in an effort to get the nerve symptoms to settle.</li><br />	<li><em>Local Lidocaine patches: </em>Local anesthetic patches applied to nerve injuries can often improve a patient's symptoms, and perhaps stop the pain cycle that can lead to a full blow CRPS.</li><br />	<li><em>Sympathetic blocks: </em>Blocking the sympathetic nerves at the level of the spine can help improve the symptoms associated with CRPS.  These are performed under x-ray guidance by physicians with expertise in these type of blocks.</li><br />	<li><em>Anti-depressant medications: </em>It is not uncommon for patients to benefit from a course of anti-depressant medications to help break the cycle associated with CRPS.</li><br />	<li><em>Vitamin C:</em>  There are some studies that suggest that taking vitamin C daily before and after surgery may minimize the risk of developing CRPS.</li><br /></ul><br /><h3><a name="dvt"></a>Deep Vein Thrombosis</h3><br />A DVT (Deep Vein Thrombosis) is a blood clot in the lower leg veins, which are the veins that help carry blood back to the heart. It is a relatively uncommon, but potentially serious complication of foot surgery.  Symptoms of a DVT range from no symptoms at all to marked swelling and discomfort of the lower leg. Having a blood clot in the leg is a worrisome problem because it can be a precursor to a pulmonary embolism.  A pulmonary embolism occurs when a blood clot forms and then breaks away and goes to the lungs, where it can be fatal.Patients who have had significant blood clotting in one of their legs may suffer from chronic swelling and engorgement of that leg. This is a condition known as post thrombotic (or post-phlebitic) syndrome.Risk factors for a DVT (Blood clot) include the three elements described by Virchow in the 1800's:<br /><ol><br /><ol><br />	<li><em>Stasis </em>(blood that does not move freely) such as may occur in a patient who is immobilized on the operating table for a while, or someone who is immobilized in a cast.  In both instances, normal lower extremity muscle contracting is diminished, and this decreases normal venous blood flow.</li><br />	<li><em>Hypercoaguability of the blood (easy clotting)</em>.  There can be a family predisposition to increased blood clotting, so a positive family history of a blood clot may be important.  Also smoking, the use of birth control pills, and the presence of certain cancers, can increase a patient's tendency to form blood clots.</li> <a name="bloodvesselinjury"><br />	<li><em>Endothelial (blood vessel) injury</em>.  Trauma or surgery may increase </li></a> blood vessel injury, which in turn can increase the chance of a blood clot forming.<br /></ol><br /></ol><br /> Based on Virchow's Triad, the risk of having a blood clot in the leg is increased with:<br /><ul><br />	<li>Immobilization</li><br />	<li>Direct injury</li><br />	<li>Obesity</li><br />	<li>Birth Control Pill or other hormone use</li><br />	<li>Positive family history (first degree relative)</li><br />	<li>Previous history of a blood clot (perhaps the most important risk factor)</li><br /></ul><br />Prophylaxis against blood clotting can include: mechanical devices to squeeze the lower leg muscles when patients are anesthetized, or thinning the blood with medications.Unlike major surgery on the hip and knee, symptomatic blood clots after foot surgery are relatively uncommon without a major risk factor: the risk of a blood clot is about 1 in 100.  Prophylaxis against blood clot formation using medication tends to significantly increase the risk of bleeding.  This bleeding risk in turn increases the risk of wound healing problems and infection.  For this reason, most foot surgeons do not routinely give blood thinners following foot surgery if there are no major blood clotting risk factors.<br /><h3><a name="continued-pain"></a>Failure to Resolve ALL Symptoms</h3><br />Some pain may still be present even after successful foot or ankle surgery.  It is important to appreciate that there are MANY different potential sources of pain in the foot and ankle.  Operations on the foot and ankle are usually designed to address pathology (and the resulting pain) from specific areas of the foot.  A successful surgery on one area of the foot may have no effect on pain originating elsewhere in the foot or ankle.For example, an ankle fusion or ankle replacement may eradicate most or all of the pain symptoms stemming from an arthritic ankle joint. However, these procedures will have no appreciable effect on symptoms that are originating from ligaments and tendons outside of the ankle joint, or arthritis that involves any of the surrounding joints.  In fact, arthritis in the surrounding joints, such as the subtalar and talonavicular joint, may actually be worsened following an ankle fusion.<br /><h3><a name="infection"></a>Infection</h3><br />Serious deep infection following foot surgery does not happen commonly.  About 1/100 or less patients experience this complication following a surgical procedure.  Re-hospitalization and intravenous treatment may be required to treat a serious post-operative infection.  People with diabetes, smokers, and those who have had a previous infection in the area, are at a higher risk for developing an infection.<br /><h3><a name="nerve-injury"></a>Nerve Injury / Neuritis</h3><br />Numbness over the incision is a common occurrence following surgery.  However, it is a more serious problem if a nerve that affects muscle or sensory control is injured.  This can occur when a nerve is placed under traction, or when it is directly injured.  The risk of nerve injuries varies widely, depending on the particular operation.  Therefore it is important for any patient contemplating foot surgery to discuss the potential risk of a nerve injury.An injury to one of the nerves of the foot often leads to a neuritis (painful inflammation of a nerve).  The initial nerve injury may be relatively minor, such as:  a nerve that is stretched while retracting the soft-tissues during surgery; or a nerve that becomes enmeshed in scar tissue that forms in response to post-operative bleeding.  This type of nerve irritation creates symptoms, such as numbness and/or a burning sensation along the course of the nerve.  The localized nerve injury is often associated with a surgical incision, and pressing on the area of the nerve injury may create a sharp pain or sense of discomfort along the course of the nerve, which is known as a &quot;Tinel sign&quot;.  Examples of operations that may lead to local nerve injuries include:<br /><ul><br />	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-arthroscopy"><em>Ankle arthroscopy</em></a></strong> where the outside (lateral) incision (portal) is right near a branch of the superficial peroneal nerve.</li><br />	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-fracture-surgery"><em>Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of an ankle fracture</em></a></strong> where the outside (lateral) incision may injure or irritate the superficial peroneal nerve.</li><br />	<li><em>Tarsal tunnel release</em> where the tibial nerve is exposed and released but often heals with excessive scar formation, leading to increased pain.</li><br /></ul><br /><h3><a name="non-union"></a>Delayed Union / Non-Union</h3><br />Many foot and ankle operations involve fusing joints (arthrodesis) or attempting to get fractures to heal.  If a joint has not fused or a fracture has not adequately healed in the time that healing would be expected, then the area is said to be a delayed union.  The time expected to achieve adequate healing can vary widely, from 6 weeks-10 weeks (or even longer), depending on the size of the joint, the blood supply to the area, and how immobilized the area is.  Many delayed unions will go on to eventually heal.  Some delayed unions can be encouraged to heal with the use of a bone stimulator, which passes current through the area to encourage bone healing.  If no evidence of satisfactory healing has been demonstrated after a certain period of time (usually 6 months), then this is described as a &quot;non-union.&quot;  Risk factors for a non-union include:<br /><ul><br />	<li><em>Smoking</em> (Typically increases the risk of non-union by 3X)</li><br />	<li><em>Inadequate immobilization</em> (either because the pateint walked on the area too soon, or because the fixation was poor)</li><br />	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/diabetes"><em>Diabetes</em></a></strong></li><br />	<li><em>Poor blood supply to the area</em> (One of the reasons smoking is a big risk factor)</li><br />	<li><em>Previous non-union in the area</em> (i.e. revision surgery for non-union has a much higher rate of non-union)</li><br /></ul><br />The rate of non-union varies widely, depending on the patients risk factors, the joints involved, and the fixation obtained by the surgeon.  Typically non-union rates in otherwise healthy and compliant patietns are on the order of 5-10% for many common foot fusions (ex. <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-fusion-arthrodesis">ankle fusion</a></strong></em>, <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/subtalar-fusion">subtalar fusion</a></strong></em>), but may be lower if there is lots of good healing bone (ex. <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/calcaneal-osteotomy"><em><strong>Calcaneal Osteotomy</strong></em></a>) or higher in areas of the foot where the blood supply may be tenuous and the forces great (ex. talonavicular fusions).<br /><h3><a name="pe"></a>Pulmonary Embolism (PE)</h3><br />A pulmonary embolism occurs when a blood clot breaks off and goes to the lungs.  This is a very serious condition and can be potentially fatal.  Fortunately, this is a very uncommon complication, occurring in less than 1/3000 patients who undergo foot and ankle surgery.  Pulmonary embolisms more commonly occur in patients undergoing hip and knee surgeries.  Your surgeon may anti-coagulate your blood if you have a major risk factor for developing a PE.<br /><h3><a name="vascular-injury"></a>Vascular Injury</h3><br />Bleeding is not very common during surgery due to the use of a tourniquet.  Vascular injuries that can occur following surgery include loss of blood supply to a distal extremity (like a toe).  People with vascular diseases and <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/diabetes">diabetes</a></strong></em> are at higher risk for developing a vascular injury.  Certain procedures on toes carry a higher risk for vascular injury.<br /><h3><a name="wound-healing-problems"></a>Wound Healing Problems</h3><br />Wound healing problems include scarring and wound breakdown that can lead to infection. This complication occurs in about 1/100 or less patients.  People with <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/diabetes">diabetes</a></strong></em>, smokers, and those who have had previous surgery are at a higher risk for having a problem with wound healing.<br /><p>Edited August 24th, 2015</p>
<h2>Physical Therapy Protocol</h2><br /><h4>Stage 2 Acquired Adult Flatfoot Deformity (Posterior Tibial Tendon Dysfunction)</h4><br />This is an outline of a non-operative protocol for treating Stage 2 <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/acquired-adult-flatfoot-deformity-posterior-tibial-tendon-dysfunction">Acquired Adult Flatfoot Deformity</a></strong></em>.  The details of this protocol are reported in a research paper published in the January 2006 edition of Foot and Ankle International (Alvarez RG, Marini A, Schmitt C, Saltzman CL. Stage 1 and 2 Posterior Tibial Tendon Dysfunction Treated by a Structured Nonoperative Management Protocol:  An Orthosis and Exercise Program.  FAI Vol. 27(1): 1-8, Jan 2006).<strong>What is</strong> <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/acquired-adult-flatfoot-deformity-posterior-tibial-tendon-dysfunction">Acquired Adult Flatfoot Deformity (Posterior Tibial Tendon Dysfunction)?</a></strong></em>This condition is characterized by a symptomatic flatfoot deformity.  Patients are typically symptomatic on the inside (medial) ankle but may also experience pain on the outside (lateral) hindfoot, due to bony impingement.  This condion often becomes symptomatic (after many years of a flatfoot deformity) when the medial structures (including the posterior tibial tendon) stretch out and become incompetent. A Stage 2 deformity is characterized by the patient's inability to perform a single leg heel lift.  This test, which requires the patient to stand on one leg and elevate the heel, requires a functional posterior tibial tendon to be completed.  Typically in Stage 2 AAFD, the posterior tibial tendon is stretched out beyond it's working length, but is not actually ruptured.<br /><h2>Uniqueness of this treatment protocol</h2><br />What is unique about this treatment protocol is that it is the first time that a study has actually shown that patients can regain function of their posterior tibial tendon after it has stretched out.  Prior to this study, patients could only look to control their symptoms with bracing, or undergo surgical reconstruction. 88% of the study patients were satisfied, and 83% reported the ability to perform multiple single leg heel rises after an average of four months of the treatment protocol.<br /><h2>Key elements of the treatment protocol</h2><br />The treatment protocol has two components:<br /><ol><br />	<li>Bracing to protect and support the injured medial structures</li><br />	<li>A high repetition, low resistance, strengthening program to gradually strengthen the posterior tibial tendon</li><br /></ol><br /><h2>Limitations of the protocol</h2><br />The protocol does not address the underlying foot deformity, nor does it undo the damage that has already been done to the tendon. However, it can significantly improve symptoms and function.  The implication of these limitations are that patients will be at risk for recurrence of symptoms, and they will likely have to do a scaled down version of the exercise regimen 3-4x per week for the rest of their lives, to minimize the risk of recurrent symptoms.  In addition, patients that are looking to regularly perform high demand activities (ex. running) may find this difficult.<br /><h2>Which patients are NOT candidates for this protocol?</h2><br />Any patient with a dysfunctional posterior tibial tendon where the tendon itself is not in continuity, is not a candidate for this protocol.  Approximately 1 out of 10 patients with Stage 2 acquired adult flatfoot deformity fall into this category. To determine wheter the posterior tibial tendon is intact, the patient is asked to invert the foot, and the tendon is palpated. If it is unclear whether the tendon is intact, an MRI can be ordered (Routine MRIs are NOT needed to diagnose this condition).  The MRI will show a grossly abnormal posterior tibial tendon, but what is important is whether the tendon itself is in continuity.<br /><h2>The BRACING Component of the Treatment Protocol</h2><br />Bracing is instituted to support the overloaded (and chronically injured) medial structures, including the stretched out posterior tibial tendon. For patients with Stage 2 deformities characterized by the inability to do a single heel rise, a <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-foot-orthosis-afo">custom mold AFO</a></strong></em> is recommended in the study. We have found that patients are often more comfortable in a custom molded Arizona Ankle Lacer. However, some patients find this too hot and we have recently been using the Aircast Posterior tibial Ankle Lacer. This has been pretty successful, and has the advantage of being an over the counter device that patients can begin using right away. After a few months of the protocol, once they have regained some function in their posterior tibial tendon, patients may be transitioned to an over the counter orthotic with a medical arch support. Patients should wear their brace or orthotic any time they are walking.<br /><h2>The PHYSICAL THERAPY component of the treatment protocol</h2><br />The physical therapy protocol is a high repetition, low resistance protocol. Walking and standing normally puts 2-4 x body weight through the posterior tibial tendon. These forces are initially far too high to allow the tendon to function, however, by starting at much lower forces, the tendon can be rehabilitated. The role of the physical therapist is to education and evaluate, not to supervise every exercise session. Patients need to do their exercise routine daily during the four months or more of the protocol, in order for it to be successful. The physical therapist will see the patient 8-10 times during this four month period, typically weekly for the first 4 weeks and then biweekly after that. Patients should follow up with their treating physician after 4-6 weeks to monitor their progress. After successful completion of the protocol, patients should continue performing a truncated version of their exercise routine 3x per week, indefinitely.<br /><h4>Phase 1</h4><br /><ul><br />	<li><em>Sole to sole exercises</em> (start at 4 sets of 10, increase daily until 12 sets of 25 can be performed). In this exercise, the patient sits with their feet dangling and inverts each foot, trying to bring the soles together. In doing this, the patient fires the posterior tibial tendon with only gravity as resistance.</li><br />	<li><em>Picking up a ball with the heels (alternative exercise).</em> With the patient sitting and the feet dangling on the ground, a ball is placed between the feet and the patient picks up the ball by inverting each foot and trapping the ball in the arch of the foot (start at 4 sets of 10, increase daily until 12 sets of 25 can be performed). Some patients find this easier to do than the sole to sole exercises.</li><br /></ul><br /><h4>Phase 2</h4><br />This phase starts when the patient can comfortably do 12 sets of 25 repetitions of one of the Phase 1 exercises, usually 10-14 days after the exercises program is started.<br /><ul><br />	<li>Continue Phase 1 routine as a warm up</li><br />	<li><em>Exercises against resistance.</em> An exercise routine using a red exercise band as resistance is instituted.  Inversion, eversion, and dorsiflexion is performed, although the inversion exercises are the most important.  Movements are performed with a controlled eccentric return without rotating the leg.  Start with 4 sets of 10 repetitions, and gradually increase the number of sets and repetitions until 10 sets of 20 repetitions (200 total) can be performed.</li><br />	<li><em>Double Leg Heel Rises. </em> With the patient standing and holding on to a wall or a chair for balance, they should raise their heels off the ground in a controlled manner. The uninvolved leg should take 75-85% of the body weight.  Patients should start at 4 sets of 5 repetitions, and progress to 10 sets of 20 repetitions.</li><br /></ul><br />Phase 2 will typically take 4-8 weeks to complete. Patients should progress gradually! If the patient has a flareup of symptoms, they should back off their routine for a few days until the symptoms improve.<br /><h4>Phase 3</h4><br />This phase begins when the patient can comfortably perform a total of 200 repetitions of the exercises against resistance, and the double leg heel rises as described in Phase 2.<br /><ul><br />	<li>Continue Phase 1 routine as a warm up</li><br />	<li><em>Exercises against resistance.</em>  Continue the exercise routine using a stiffer exercise band as resistance, as with the Phase 2 exercises inversion, eversion, and dorsiflexion are performed, although the inversion exercises are the most important. Movements are performed with a controlled eccentric return without rotating the leg. Continue to focus on higher repetitions, working up to 200-300 repetitions total (ex 10 sets of 20-30 reps).</li><br />	<li><em>Double Leg Heel Rises.</em>  With the patient standing and holding on to a wall or a chair for balance, they should raise their heels off the ground in a controlled manner.  The uninvolved leg now takes only 50% of the body weight.  Patients should start at 4 sets of 5 repetitions and progress to 10 sets of 20 repetitions.</li><br />	<li><em>Single leg heel rises.</em>  Patient may attempt some single leg heel rises.  This exercise should be done in a controlled manner.</li><br />	<li><em>Toe walking.</em>  Patient should attempt toe walking for 10 feet, keeping the knees straight. Gradually progress until 5 x 100 feet can be performed.</li><br /></ul><br />Phase 3 typically lasts 4-8 weeks.<br /><h2>Stabilization Protocol</h2><br />After completing the Treatment protocol, the patient should develop a routine of double leg heel rises, exercises against resistance, and toe walking that takes 10-15 minutes to complete.  They should perform this routine a minimum of 3 times.<br /><p>Edited September 10th, 2015</p>
<h2>Indications: who should perform Plantar Fascia specific stretching?</h2><br />A plantar fascia specific stretch creates a focused stretch on the plantar fascia, and therefore is ideal for individuals who suffer from <em><strong><a href="/plantar-fasciitis">Plantar Fasciitis</a></strong></em>.  Because it creates an isolated stretch on the plantar fascia, it has been shown to be highly effective in the management of plantar fasciitis when performed regularly over a 6-8 week period.  As Plantar Fasciitis has a tendency to recur, it is helpful to perform this stretch regularly after the Plantar Fasciitis has resolved.<br /><h2>How it's done</h2><br /><ol><br />	<li>Cross your affected leg over your other leg.</li><br />	<li>Using the hand on your affected side, take hold of your affected foot and pull your toes back towards shin (Figure 1). This creates tension/stretch in the arch of the foot/plantar fascia.</li><br />	<li>Check for the appropriate stretch position by gently rubbing the thumb of your unaffected side from left to right over the arch of the affected foot (Figure 2). The plantar fascia should feel firm, like a guitar string.</li><br />	<li>Hold the stretch for a count of 10.</li><br />	<li>Perform at least 3 sets of stretches per day (1 set = 10 repetitions). You cannot perform the stretch too often.</li><br /></ol><br />The most important times to stretch are before taking the first step in the morning, and before standing after a period of prolonged sitting. Most patients perform the stretch 4-5 times during the day for the first month, and then on a semi-regular basis (3-4 times per week).  Decreased pain, with improvement of about 25-50% is expected at 6 weeks, with resolution of symptoms over 3-6 months.<br /><h5>Figure 1 (Top) and Figure 2 (Bottom)</h5><br />[Content: /wp-content/uploads/2010/08/P9200031-1024x768.jpg Goes Here]<br />[Content: /wp-content/uploads/2010/08/P9200032-1024x768.jpg Goes Here]Information courtesy of <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/benedict-f-digiovanni-md-editor" target="_blank">Ben DiGiovanni, MD</a></strong></em><br /><p><span style="font-size: 10px;">Edited September 19, 2015<br /></span></p>
<h2>Indications: who should perform Proprioception?</h2><br />Proprioception is the ability of your brain to sense the position of a joint (ex. ankle), and control its movement relative to the rest of the body. Proprioceptive ability is often lost or diminished following an injury. Proprioception needs to be worked on in order for a joint to return completely to or near its pre-injury level. Joints that do not have normal propriception are more likely to be re-injured because they will more easily be placed in an extreme position before the brain reacts (i.e. when the brain realizes that the ankle has excessively rolled, it is too late and an ankle sprain results).<br />Any patient that has suffered a significant ankle or hindfoot injury (ex. Ankle sprain, ankle fracture, etc.), or has undergone ankle or foot surgery, should perform some proprioceptive exercises in order to optimize their recovery.<br /><h2>How it's done</h2><br />Perform a graduated program that works to improve proprioception until both the right and left sides have equal propriceptive ability (assuming one side is uninjured).  Compare to your uninjured side (do exercises on both sides until each side is equal). Consider the following guidelines:<br /><ol><br />	<li>Do exercises daily</li><br />	<li>Do exercises for 30 seconds and repeat for 5-10 repetitions</li><br />	<li>Gradually progress the complexity of the exercises:</li><br /></ol><br /><strong>Basic Exercise</strong><br /><ul><br />	<li>Stand on one foot on a flat surface with your eyes open (30 seconds)</li><br /></ul><br /><strong>Higher difficulty</strong><br /><ul><br />	<li>Stand on one foot on a flat surface with your eyes closed (30 seconds). Have something available to grab if you lose your balance.</li><br /></ul><br /><strong>Even higher difficulty</strong><br /><ul><br />	<li>Stand on one foot on a flat surface with your eyes closed and move your head from side to side (30 seconds). Have something available to grab if you lose your balance.</li><br /></ul><br /><strong>Highest difficulty</strong><br /><ul><br />	<li>Stand on one foot on a soft surface (ex. a pillow or bed) with your eyes closed, and move your head from side to side (30 seconds). Have something available to grab if you lose your balance.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>Edited September 19, 2015</p>
<h2>Indications: who should do resisted eversion exercises?</h2><br />Patients with weakness of the muscles on the outside of the ankle, or patients who suffer recurrent ankle sprains, may benefit from exercises to strengthen their ankle everters - the muscles that moves the ankle and foot outwards (Figure 1A and 1B). Muscle weakness often occurs with disuse following surgery or an ankle or foot injury. Also, exercises to increase ankle eversion strength are often prescribed as treatment for patients with ankle instability.<br /><h2>How it's done</h2><br />A stretching band is attached to a fixed object such as a doorknob, and then wrapped around the outside of the foot (Figure 1). The foot is then moved in an outward direction against resistance.  This motion is repeated 10-20 times. A total of 3-6 sets should be performed.<br /><p>Edited September 19, 2015</p>
<h2>Indications: who should undergo scar massage?</h2><br />Patients who have undergone surgery or who have suffered a cut on their foot may benefit from scar massage.  Scar massage may be most beneficial in patients who are developing an exuberant (hypertrophic) scar; have tethering of the underlying tissues to the skin; or where there is evidence of a nerve that is entrapped in a healing wound.  It is critical that scar massage not be started until basic wound healing has occurred (usually a minimum of 3-4 weeks post-surgery) or else there is a chance that the wound will open up.<br /><h2>How it's done</h2><br />Gently rub the wound in a circular manner.  Move back and forth across the wound.  It may be helpful to apply a vitamin E based cream to make the massaging easier.  It is helpful to gradually try and move the skin away from the underlying tissue.  Consider massaging for 5-10 minutes per day.  Stop if there is any evidence of wound breakdown or if symptoms are significantly aggravated.<br /><p>Edited September 19, 2015</p>

<h2>Indications</h2><br />A painful or loose (unstable) ankle will often benefit from ankle taping to control motion, decrease pain, minimize the risk of reinjury, and improve athletic performance.  Ankle taping serves the same role as an <em><strong><a href="/ankle-lacers">ankle lacer</a></strong></em> or an ankle support; however, ankle taping can often provide more support, and less bulk that ankle lacers.  In addition, ankle taping can be customized for each person to improve comfort and functionality.<br /><h2>Thoughts on Ankle Taping</h2><br />Ankle taping is somewhat time intensive. It can take a few minutes to tape your ankle appropriately.  Furthermore, there is often a learning curve associated with taping ankles: you will not necessarily &quot;get it right&quot; the first time.  However, with practice you can learn to tape your ankle (or someone else's) quite efficiently and effectively.<br /><h2>Materials Needed</h2><br /><ul><br />	<li>Pre-wrap to cover the ankle or alternatively a neoprene ankle sleeve</li><br /></ul><br /><ul><br />	<li>One roll of strong cloth tape (ex. hockey stick tape)</li><br /></ul><br />Ensure that the skin is clean and dry prior to starting the ankle taping<br /><h2>Instructions</h2><br /><h4>1.  Place a Pre-wrap or an ankle sleeve.  (Figure 1)</h4><br />Tape can not be applied directly to the skin.  A pre-wrap (ex. Pro wrap) should be placed over the ankle.  Alternatively, a neoprene ankle sleeve or ankle support can be pulled over the ankle (The Adams Modification) and the tape applied directly to the ankle sleeve.<br /><h5>Figure 1</h5><br />[Content: /wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Figure-1-Resized.jpg Goes Here]<br /><h4>2.  Position the foot appropriately prior to wrapping (Figure 2)</h4><br />The ankle should be setup in the exact position that it should be in after taping.  This is usually neutral dorsiflexion (90 degrees relative to the lower leg) with the hindfoot everted (positioned so that the structures on the outside of the ankle are tight).  It is often easiest to recreate this position by placing the forefoot on the edge of a chair.  The knee should be bent to make it easier to bring the ankle up to a neutral position.<br /><h5>Figure 2</h5><br />[Content: /wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Figure-2-Taping-Ankle-Positioning-foot-Resized.jpg Goes Here]<br /><h4>3. The &quot;Medial Stirrups&quot; are applied  (Figure 3)</h4><br />Tape wrapped from the inside to the outside of the ankle and then around the top of the ankle is applied. This is done to help pull the ankle joint to the outside (valgus position).  This wrap is performed by:<br /><ul><br />	<li>Start the tape on the inside above the ankle and wrapping under the arch of the foot (Figure 3A).</li><br />	<li>Apply appropriate force on the tape to securely position the ankle joint in a stable position.</li><br />	<li>Continuing around the ankle joint from the outside (Figure 3B)</li><br />	<li>Ending by wrapping once or twice around above the ankle joint (Figure 3C)</li><br />	<li>This is then repeated three times (four times if you need a particularly secure taping) with the three wraps placed side by side (Figure 3D)</li><br /></ul><br /><h5>Figure 3A: Start on the inside of the ankle, wrap under the arch</h5><br />[Content: /wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Figure-2-Taping-Ankle-Positioning-foot-Resized1.jpg Goes Here]<br /><h5>Figure 3B: Continue around the ankle joint from the outside</h5><br />[Content: /wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Figure-3B-Taping-Ankles-Resized.jpg Goes Here]<br /><h5>Figure 3C: Wrap tape 1-2 times around the leg above the ankle joint</h5><br />[Content: /wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Figure-3C-Taping-Ankles-Resized.jpg Goes Here]<br /><h5>Figure 3D: Repeat 2-4 times</h5><br />[Content: /wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Figure-3D-Taping-Ankles-Resized.jpg Goes Here]<br /><h4>4.  Medial and Lateral &quot;Heel Lock&quot; is applied (Figure 4)</h4><br />Tape is then applied to &quot;lock&quot; the heel into position.  This is performed by:<br /><ul><br />	<li>Starting on the inside above the ankle joint (similar to performing the &quot;medial stirrup&quot; wrap) and wrapping the tape across the sole of the foot, more towards the heel region.</li><br />	<li>Tape is then wrapped around the ankle similar, to the &quot;medial stirrup&quot; wrap</li><br />	<li>This process is then repeated EXCEPT that it is done in the opposite direction, with the tape starting on the outside of the ankle and wrapping under the heel to the inside and then around the ankle. (Figure 4)</li><br />	<li>This process is then repeated for the inside and outside heel wraps.  This means that when you are finished there are two wraps of tape &quot;locking&quot; the heel starting from the inside, and two wraps that have been started from the outside.</li><br /></ul><br /><h5>Figure 4: Lateral &quot;heel Lock&quot;  taping outside to inside</h5><br />[Content: /wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Figure-4-Heel-Lock-Resized.jpg Goes Here]<br /><p>Edited October 4, 2015</p>
[Content: /wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Cam-Walker-Resized.jpg Goes Here]Cam walkers are often used following foot or ankle surgery or after an injury.  These devices help protect the injured area.  They provide relative immobilization.  They also allow for some limited walking (if this is indicated), and will serve to disperse the force of walking more evenly up the leg, due to the rigid sole and the rounded (rocker-bottom contour) of the sole.Cam walkers add 1&quot;-2&quot; of extra height, and this combined with favoring the injured or healing side will often lead to a very uneven limp (asymmetric gait). This will tend to aggravate the back, hip, or knee.  Secondary symptoms in this area are common when recovering from foot or ankle surgery or injury.  To help counteract this, it is helpful to wear a shoe with an equivalent lift on the opposite foot.<br /><p>Edited September 19th, 2015</p>
While canes are a similar concept to crutches and can be very helpful in controlling symptoms, they are not necessarily as powerful in minimizing loading. They tend to work best for patients with small problems with balance or instability, with some weakness in their leg or trunk, with an injury, or with pain.The top of the cane should come up to the crease of your wrist when you stand up straight. The elbow should be a little bent when you hold the cane.There are two ways to use a cane. In order to most off-load the area, it is used in the same hand as the involved foot. For example, if your right ankle is hurting, putting the cane down beside it when you step with it results in almost all of the force going through the cane and very little through the foot. While using the cane in the same hand as the injured foot enables you to off-load the foot more, the downside is that you end up walking with a very asymmetric gait, and the shift in torque puts a lot of stress on your back.Much more commonly with the cane, and what most medical professionals encourage, is to use the cane in the opposite hand of the involved foot so that the cane and involved leg swing and strike the ground at the same time. If your right foot is hurting, put the cane in your left hand. As you step forward, put 50% of your weight on your right foot and 50% of your weight on your left hand and then step forward with the left foot. This method is preferred because it enables you to have a much more symmetrical gait (more like a normal walking pattern) and avoid walking with a marked limp.To go up stairs with a cane, use the handrail for assistance and step up on the &quot;good&quot; leg first. Then, using the cane in the opposite hand of the involved foot so that it takes half of the load, step on the involved foot. To go down stairs, first put the cane down on the step and then the involved foot. Then put down the &quot;good&quot; foot, which should carry most of the load.<br /><p>Edited October 4, 2015</p>
[Content: /wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Crutch-Labeled-1-423x1024.jpg Goes Here]While crutches are one of the most common off-loading devices, they do require some balance and coordination to master. Crutches cause the upper body to take the weight instead of the legs. Using crutches markedly decreases the amount of force going through the involved foot, either completely eliminating the force or reducing it to a minimal, controlled amount, resulting in less pain. Patients may put weight on their &quot;good&quot; or uninjured foot, and ease into using the involved foot to simulate walking or a normal gait pattern, as their injury heals.Most important is that they are fitted appropriately to the user. Using crutches set at an incorrect height can irritate the nerves traveling from the spine into the arms, resulting in some numbness or tingling in your fingers and hands. Incorrect arm angle and hand position can cause compression of the ulnar nerve which runs through the palm of the hand, causing numbness in the outer two fingers (pinky and ring finger) and may even lead to weakness in the muscles of the hand.The main disadvantage of crutches is that patients end up putting all the weight that they would normally put through their leg, through their shoulders, so it is not uncommon to exacerbate existing shoulder problems, such as rotator cuff tendonitis or arthritis.<br /><h2>A Crutch: How-To</h2><br /><h4>Fit Crutches</h4><br />Hold the crutches at the side of your body. Appropriate crutch pad height is not directly under your arm, but rather about two inches below the armpit when shoulders are relaxed. You can estimate this distance by using two to three finger breadths to ensure that you are not loading the armpits. Make sure you hold them with your arms, and not jammed into your armpits. Adjust the handgrip so that the elbow is flexed at about 15 to 30 degrees. When you take a step, your arm should fully straighten so that you are loading through locked elbows.<br /><h4>Crutch</h4><br />In order to become a crutch master, you need to learn about the tripod position - the position in which you stand and from which you begin walking, when using crutches. Your feet should be facing forward, together, keeping your weight off of the injured foot. The crutches are loosely underneath your armpits so that the poles are about four to six inches to the side and in front of each foot, and your elbows are slightly bent. This arrangement of the feet and crutch poles creates a solid and stable triangular base at which you are able to rest as well as be ready to move forward.To walk, begin in the tripod position, then lean forward slightly and pick up both crutches and place them about one to two feet in front of your legs. Move the affected foot/leg forward (as if stepping) but shift your weight to the crutches instead of using the foot. As you transfer weight from the &quot;good&quot; (weight-bearing) foot to the crutches, keep your arms straight so that you load through locked elbows. Then, let the momentum of the crutches carry your body forward, lightly swing the &quot;good&quot; foot forward through the crutches as you put it down. Be careful not to land too far in front of the crutches. When the &quot;good&quot; foot is on the ground, move your crutches ahead in preparation for the next step. Keep focused on where you are walking, not on your feet. Watch out for slippery surfaces and make sure you wear well-fitting, low-heeled shoes (or shoe).<br /><h4>Crutch Around Chairs</h4><br />There comes a time for every crutch master to hang up their crutches long enough to sit down and give their upper body a break. To avoid needless injuries, care must be taken even when settling down to relax. Make sure that the chair is stable and will not roll or slide, and has arms and back support (especially since it is the upper body that needs resting). Before you begin, get close enough to the chair so that the backs of your legs are touching the front of the seat and keep your injured foot in front of you. To ease yourself down with balance and stability, place both crutches in one hand and your other hand on the chair arm. Follow the same rules when raising yourself from the chair - use the stable chair arm, on one side, and the crutches on the other side, for support.<br /><h4>Crutch Up Stairs</h4><br />While your crutching prowess improves with practice, stairs can prove difficult to tackle no matter how long you've been at it. For patients with serious injuries or for those fresh out of surgery, conservative methods should be employed for stair climbing - seated. Place the crutches up the stairs as far as you can reach and move them up as you progress. Start by sitting down on the bottom step and reaching your arms behind you. Then push yourself to the next step using your arms and &quot;good&quot; (weight-bearing) leg. Keep inching your way up until you make it to the top. The same pattern should be followed when going down stairs.Patients with more stable injuries and enough strength and flexibility may elect to crutch up the stairs a different way. Stay balanced by facing the stairway and holding the handrail with one hand and using both crutches under the other arm. When going up, lead with the &quot;good&quot; foot, keeping the affected food behind you. When going down, keep the affected foot out in front, and hop down each stair on the &quot;good&quot; foot. Take it one step at a time. If the stairs do not have handrails, you will have to use more strength to hop up or down on the &quot;good&quot; leg using the crutches under both arms.<br /><p>Edited October 4, 2015</p>
A Knee Walker is basically a rolling stool with a padded cushion on which to rest the knee and with handlebars with which to steer and maintain balance (Figure 1). This device enables patients to take the force through the knee instead of through the involved foot or ankle, or through the arms in the case of crutches. It is an excellent way to completely off-load the foot and still get around.

The height of the knee platform should be adjusted to the level of the knee in a natural standing position to avoid hip strain or discomfort. To move forward, alternate between stepping on the &quot;good&quot; foot and rolling on the involved side where the knee takes the force.Even though the knee walker allows for a relatively smooth movement, it still does create asymmetry of movement and may cause other areas of the body to be aggravated (hip, back, etc.) In addition, knee walkers are substantially more expensive that crutches.

<h2>Background</h2><br />Orthotic inserts (either prefabricated or custom) may be helpful in the treatment of certain established foot and ankle conditions, such as <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/plantar-fasciitis">plantar fasciitis</a></strong></em>, <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/acquired-adult-flatfoot-deformity-posterior-tibial-tendon-dysfunction">acquired adult flatfoot deformity</a></strong></em>, <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/metatarsalgia">metatarsalgia</a></strong></em>, and <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/peroneal-tendonitis">peroneal tendonitis</a></strong></em>.  Orthotics work by providing a supportive base for the foot to rest on.  This serves to partially realign the foot, and most importantly to help disperse the force going through the sole of the foot over a wider area. An orthotic is like a bed for your foot. Just as a good bed will support your back when you sleep, a good orthotic will support your foot when you stand and walk. Similar to when you purchase a bed, you may want to check out various orthotics before purchase, but usually a custom product is not needed.Most stores specializing in comfort shoes, as well as many running and hiking stores, will carry a wide array of orthotics.  In addition, many online stores have a wide selection of reasonably priced orthotics, although they have the disadvantage of not being able to try them on for fit.<br /><h2>Things to look for in an orthotic:</h2><br /><h4>Comfortable upper surface</h4><br />The top 2-5mm of an orthotic should provide a soft surface for the foot to rest against. Many orthotics are made of materials that will change shape overtime, based on the loading that the orthotic is exposed to (i.e. if you have a lot of pressure in a certain area of the foot, a depression will develop there over time). Some pre-fabricated orthotics are heat moldable. They can be heated in the oven and then stepped on to help start the process of accommodating to your foot.<br /><h4>Semi-rigid base</h4><br />The soft surface of the orthotics should sit on a semi-rigid base that gives the orthotic its shape. Usually, this base includes an arch support. The height and stiffness of the arch may determine how comfortable the orthotic is for the patient. Determining an appropriate arch height and stiffness can be counter intuitive. For example, if a patient has a markedly flatfoot, a stiff arch support to prop up the arch may seem desirable.  However, this type of arch may create too much localized discomfort in the midfoot, and these patients may be best served with a lower, more flexible arch. In a similar manner, it may seem intuitive that someone with a high arched foot should have an orthotic with a high arch support. However, such a high arch may serve to increase the loading on the outside of the foot, so patients with a high arched foot may be better off with a recessed area under the base of their great toe, as this will serve to position their foot in a more neutral position.<br /><h3>Sizing the orthotic</h3><br />It is important to size the orthotic appropriately. Different manufacturers make orthotics of different widths, so it is important to purchase an orthotic that is the correct size and width.<br /><h3>Orthotic add-ons for specific conditions</h3><br />Some orthotics have add-ons which can be of help in certain conditions. These may include:<br /><ul><br />	<li><em>Built in Metatarsal pad</em>: This built up mound positioned just before the base of the 2nd and 3rd toe can be helpful in the treatment of <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/metatarsalgia">metatarsalgia</a></strong></em>, by off-loading the painful area.</li><br />	<li><em>Recessed area under the base of the great toe</em>: A depression under the base of the big toe can be very helpful in patients with a high arched foot, and may help patients with <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/sesamoiditis">sesamoiditis</a></strong></em>.</li><br />	<li><em>Increased heel padding</em>: This can be helpful in patients with symptoms from overload heel pain.</li><br />	<li><em>Increased heel height</em>: Adding a few extra millimeters to the height of the heel may help in some conditions, such as insertional Achilles tendonitis.</li><br /></ul><br /><h3><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/prefabricated-over-the-counter-orthotics-versus-custom-orthotics">Custom vs Pre-Fabricated Orthotics</a></strong></em></h3><br /> <br /><p>Edited September 24, 2015</p><br /><p><span style="font-size: 10px;"><br /></span></p>
Many patients are able to effectively manage their symptoms non-operatively. However, doing so does not simply involve making a few doctor-prescribed changes. <strong><em>Successful non-surgical management of most chronic foot and ankle problems require patients themselves to gain a greater overall understanding of their condition.</em> </strong>This includes gaining a greater understanding of what improves and aggravates their symptoms. Patients who are aware of their condition, especially what irritates and alleviates their symptoms, will often be able to evolve strategies over time that allow them to effectively manage their symptoms without surgery.That is not to say that all conditions can be managed non-operatively. Patients should consult their doctors to further discuss their options and whether non-operative treatment could help them avoid a potentially unnecessary surgery. Active patient education throughout the healing process is essential to most any successful recovery.Elements of successful non-operative treatment may include:<br /><h3><em><strong><a href="/activity-modification">Activity Modification</a></strong></em></h3><br /><h3><em><strong><a href="/ankle-lacers">Bracing</a></strong></em></h3><br /><h3><em><strong><a href="/comfort-shoes">Comfort Shoes</a></strong></em></h3><br /><h3>Injections</h3><br /><ul><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/viscosupplementation">Viscosupplementation</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/prp-plasma-rich-protein-injections">PRP (Plasma-Rich Protein) injections</a></strong></em></li><br /></ul><br /><h3>Medications</h3><br /><ul><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/non-operative-treatment/acetominophen/">Acetaminophen (ex.

Acetaminophen is an analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer). Unlike other common analgesics such as aspirin and ibuprofen, acetaminophen does not block the inflammatory pathways. Studies comparing its efficacy to NSAIDs are contradictory and inconclusive. While it helps to mask the pain, it does not treat the underlying condition or its causes. However, it may enable patients to improve their ability to function and have less symptoms. Acetaminophen is indicated for relief of mild to moderate pain or discomfort from chronic and acute conditions. It is not a narcotic analgesic so it does NOT have the same side effects that are traditionally associated with narcotic pain medications (ex. drowsiness, altered level of consciousness, breathing problems). Acetaminophen can be taken 2-4 times a day to keep symptoms under control. It appears to be safe to take during pregnancy, and does not affect the closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus as NSAIDs can. Unlike aspirin, it appears to be safe in children when taken appropriately.<br /><h2>Potential Side Effects / Complications</h2><br />Acetaminophen is contraindicated for those who already have liver complications like hepatitis. Because the drug is metabolized by the liver, taking too much can cause potentially fatal liver damage. In fact, it is the most common cause of acute liver failure in both the United States and the United Kingdom. For a healthy adult with no liver problems, the daily recommended dose is a MAXIMUM of 2 grams or 4,000 mg (two 500mg tablets four times a day). In very rare cases, a normal dose could still be dangerous. The risk of liver damage is heightened by alcohol consumption, so dosage should not exceed 2,000mg if drinking alcohol. Some studies have shown that high dose-usage (greater than 2,000 mg per day) may increase the risk of upper gastrointestinal complications, such as stomach bleeding. Excessive use of Acetaminophen can damage multiple organs, especially the liver and kidney. In both organs, toxicity is not from the drug itself but from one of its metabolites, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI). Acetaminophen overdose leads to the accumulation of NAPQI, which not only causes direct cellular injury but also depletes the organ of glutathione, a natural antioxidant, leading to cell damage and death.<br /><h2>Potential Danger when Combined with Narcotic Pain Relievers!</h2><br />Although Acetaminophen is considered safe if taken at recommended levels, its prevalence in a variety of over the counter and prescription pain relievers (Vicodin, Precocet, Darvocet, Norco), fever reducers (Excedrin, Wygesic) and cough medicines (Robitussin, Sudafed) as a somewhat hidden ingredient means it is possible for patients to be unaware of the amount they consume. Also, some patients increase their dosage of prescription narcotics over time to get more of an effect. This trend could eventually deliver toxic doses of acetaminophen along with the narcotic. Some attribute 10% of fatalities from acetaminophen overdoses to combination products. A joint panel of the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee, Nonprescription Drugs Advisory Committee, and the Anesthetic and Life Support Drugs Advisory Committee met in June 2009 to advise the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on issuing new guidelines in light of recent research. The panel recommended a &quot;black box warning&quot; for prescription medications that combine acetaminophen with another drug. A &quot;black label warning&quot; designation is a type of warning appearing on the package insert for medications that may cause serious adverse effects, so named for the black border that typically surrounds it. Among several other propositions, the panel also recommended the FDA lower the maximum daily dose for acetaminophen below its current 4,000 mg, and lower the maximum single adult dose to 650 mg instead of 1,000 mg.<br /><p>Edited October 4, 2015</p>
Edited by <strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/robert-leland-md-editor/">Robert Leland MD</a></strong>Most foot problems are either caused by or aggravated by the repetitive loading that goes through the foot throughout the day. Tendons can get overloaded from the repetitive stress of standing and walking, leading to painful tendonitis. Arthritic or injured joints tend to become more painful and swollen the more they are used.  In fact, many problems in the foot or ankle are either caused by or aggravated by the cumulative force that the foot absorbs when walking and standing.  This force is proportional to:<br /><ol><br /> 	<li>The number of steps taken (or time standing) and</li><br /> 	<li>The force that goes through each step (which is determined by a person's weight and affected by their footwear, and walking surface).</li><br /> 	<li>An individual’s foot posture (very high arch or very flat foot)</li><br /></ol><br />Activity modification looks to decrease one or both of the above factors.  Activity modification does NOT necessarily involve decreasing activity level. In fact, <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/weight-loss">weight loss</a></strong></em> is often a large component of managing foot and ankle conditions, and therefore activities to burn calories and lose weight may be critical for managing chronic problems.  However, the type of activity (ex. cycling instead of running) may need to be modified to decrease the amount of force going through the foot with each step. Activity modification is really a three-fold process which includes:<br /><ol><br /> 	<li>Challenging the patient to look at their lifestyle and find out how they can take less steps and spend less time standing each day</li><br /> 	<li>Exploring strategies for how they can have less force go through their feet with each step (ex. footwear modifications, walking surfaces, etc.)</li><br /> 	<li>Identifying and avoiding activities that aggravate their symptoms.</li><br /></ol><br /><h2>Minimizing the daily load on the feet (i.e. taking fewer steps each day)</h2><br />Modifying activity in order to minimize the daily load on the feet may involve figuring out ways to sit down more or to be less on their feet. Some creativity (and perhaps some understanding on the part of their employer) can enable patients to remain seated or decrease unnecessary walking. There are also several medical devices aimed at <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/off-loading">off loading</a></strong></em> the feet.<br /><h2>Minimizing the force absorbed by the feet with each step</h2><br />Minimizing the amount of force going through the foot with each step involves looking for ways to absorb the shock of each step by selecting appropriate footwear. Patients should look for <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/comfort-shoes">comfort shoes</a></strong></em> which distribute the force evenly through the foot, and provide the right amount of support for their particular activity. For individuals with a significant foot deformity, an <strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/foot-and-ankle-medical-supplies/pre-fabricated-over-the-counter-orthotics-insert/">orthotic</a></strong> may help minimize the force to overloaded bones, joints and tendons. It also involves minimizing the amount of impact. Switching from running and walking to activities like swimming or cycling enables patients to put substantially less force through the foot, without detracting from the cardiorespiratory benefits of their exercise regimes. Restricting the amount of impact activity, such as running on softer surfaces two or three days a week instead of five, is another method by which to minimize the amount of shock on the feet.<br /><h2>Identify and avoid precipitating activities</h2><br />The third element is the idea that sometimes activities that you would not normally think of as being problematic will in fact precipitate symptoms. Precipitating activities may vary from individual to individual, depending upon the particular condition and the patient's particular characteristics (<a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/biomechanics-of-foot-and-ankle/foot-types/">foot type</a>, weight, alignment, etc.). Common activities that precipitate symptoms may include walking on uneven terrain or working out on hard surfaces. Having a better understanding of what aggravates symptoms can help patients better prevent them. To determine activities that precipitate symptoms, a patient often needs to be a bit of a detective. If symptoms are increased, think back to what was done one or two days before to try and identify any precipitating events or activities. Identifying activities that aggravate symptoms is often the first step to managing a chronic foot problem non-operatively.<br /><p>Edited May 8th 2016<span style="font-size: 10px;"><br /></span></p>
<h2><em>&quot;The patient is the best judge of what constitutes a comfortable shoe.&quot;</em></h2><br /><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/PROPERLY-FITTING-COMFORT-Shoes-Handout-Edited-01-11-2014-Matt-Buchannan.pdf">Properly Fitting Comfort Shoes Handout</a></strong></em>The following are shoe characteristics that are typically associated with a comfortable shoe:<br /><h3>A well fitted shoe</h3><br />Shoes not only need to be the correct length to fit our foot, but they also must be the correct width. Shoe manufacturers and shoe styles often vary the width of their shoes significantly. Make sure that you wear shoes that not only fit the length of your foot, but also the width.<br /><h3>Stiff sole</h3><br />A stiff sole minimizes excessive loading through the forefoot or midfoot (Figure 1a). The opposite of this would be a highly flexible sole (ex. a slipper), which tends to disproportionately load certain areas of the foot (Figure 1b).<br /><h5>Figures 1a-b</h5><br />[Content: /wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Figure-1A-Stiff-Sole-300x225.jpg Goes Here][Content: /wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Figure-1B-Flexible-sole-300x225.jpg Goes Here]<br /><h3>Rocker bottom contour</h3><br />A smooth, slightly rounded contour to the sole of the shoe will allow more even dispersion of force through the foot, as it moves from heel strike to toe off. (Figure 2)<br /><h5>Figure 2</h5><br />[Content: /wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Rocker-bottom-Contour-Resize.jpg Goes Here]<br /><h3>Wide toebox</h3><br />In general, the front of the shoe should have enough space to accommodate the front of the foot without the foot being squished (Figure 3).<br /><h3>Soft, comfortable uppers</h3><br />The material making up the upper part of the shoe, particularly covering the toes and midfoot, should be soft and somewhat flexible (ex. soft leather).<br /><h3>Soft, comfortable insert</h3><br />The bed that the foot rests on should be soft and accommodating to the foot. It may be necessary to buy a comfortable &quot;over-the-counter&quot; orthotic to replace the existing shoe insert.<br /><p>Edited October 10, 2015</p>
Corticosteroid injections cause a non-specific dampening of the inflammatory response produced by inflamed or arthritic joints and tissues, potentially providing short term pain relief. While such injections are not a permanent solution, since the underlying condition causing the inflammation remains unchanged, treatment of the symptoms enable patients to break the cycle of immobilization long enough to have the potential to restore range of motion and build strength in order to improve function in the long term.<br /><h2>What are Corticosteroids?</h2><br />Corticosteroids are a class of steroid hormone produced in the adrenal cortex involved with a wide range of physiological systems. Glucocorticoids such as cortisol control carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism and <em>reduce inflammation</em> by preventing phospholipid release, decreasing eosinophil action and other mechanisms. Cortisone, a common natural hormone, is a type of corticosteroid.<br /><h2>When are Corticosteroid injections indicated?</h2><br />Injection of a corticosteroid, like cortisone, into an inflamed or arthritic joint or an inflamed area of tissue such as a tendon or nerve may provide some short - or intermediate-term pain relief. This pain relief occurs by settling down the body's inflammation response, thereby decreasing the pain response (less inflammation often correlates with less pain).  The decrease in inflammation and pain will ideally lead to improved function.In general, care must be taken when injecting corticosteroids around tendons since corticosteroids tend to weaken the tendons, possibly predisposing them to rupture. While cortisone injections may decrease symptoms, they do not change the underlying pathology created by issues liked overloading. For example, if a patient has tendonitis or arthritis they will still have the same condition after the injection, although hopefully the symptoms from this condition will be improved. Injections just help break the cycle and allow patients to get things moving a little better. Eventually, if the underlying cause of the problem is not addressed the symptoms are likely to return.<br /><h2>How the injection is performed</h2><br />The corticosteroid injection is carried out in the doctor's office. The skin is sterilized prior to the injection (usually with betadine or alcohol) and the needle is injected into the area by feel or sometimes using fluoroscopy. Fluroscopy is an imaging technique commonly used by physicians to obtain real-time moving images of the internal structures of a patient through the use of an x-ray source and a fluorescent screen. If a joint is being injected and there is an excessive amount of fluid within the joint, the doctor may remove it prior to the injection to relieve pain by reducing the pressure of the fluid within the joint. Often, the steroid is injected with a local anesthetic like lidocaine to provided short term numbing of the area. The anesthetic typically wears off within a few hours. <em><br />This is why it is common for patients to experience worsening symptoms over the next few days before noting improvement. </em>Injections are relatively easy to administer, take effect more rapidly than traditional anti-inflammatory medications, and avoid side effects that often accompany them like stomach irritation.Cortisone injection has variable levels of effectiveness. Some patients enjoy successful results for up a number of months while others may see entirely no change. Injections are typically limited to 2-4 per year. Routine regular injections should probably be avoided if possible because each injection tends to weaken the tissue. Minimizing the inflammatory response (which is what the injections do) tends to inhibits the natural healing process. Over time, the effectiveness of the injections may diminish. Therefore, more injections do not necessarily result in greater benefits.<br /><h2>Potential risks of Corticosteroid injections</h2><br />Long term potential side effects may include thinning of the skin, bruising, an increase in local pain, and atrophy of the tissue around the injection site. There is also the risk that the corticosteroid may actually increase the rate of cartilage breakdown in the joint or weaken tendons that are injected. It is also possible for patients to have an increased inflammation in response to a corticosteroid injection that has crystallized. Finally there is always a slight risk of infection with any kind of injection. While infections as a result of injections are rare they can be very serious. As an example if an arthritic ankle joint becomes infected following a corticosteroid injection it may preclude the patient from ever undergoing a total ankle replacement as a history of a deep infection is a relative contraindication for this procedure. However, the chance of an infection is minimal if the skin adequately disinfected, sterile technique is used, and there is no local infection around the injection site. Injections may elevate blood sugar levels for patients with diabetes.<br /><p>Edited July 16th, 2014</p>
Glucosamine sulfate is a dietary supplement commonly used in the treatment of osteoarthritis. It is a type of glycosaminoglycan, which is a naturally occurring major component of joint cartilage and joint fluid. However, it is unclear how it works. The possible effects of glucosamine sulfate in patients with osteoarthritis may be due to its anti-inflammatory activity, the stimulation of proteoglycans, and the decrease in catabolic activity of cartilage cells (chondrocytes), which inhibits the synthesis of substances that damage the cartilage.Although it is approved as a medical drug in Europe, it is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for medical use in humans. While its use for treating arthritis appears safe, there is conflicting evidence as to its effectiveness. Some studies have shown that patients benefit from taking it. The OsteoArthritis Research Society International (OARSI) recommends glucosamine as the second most effective treatment in moderated cases of osteoarthritis. For any appreciable difference to become evident, patients must take it every day for at least six weeks. Animal studies suggest that chondroitin sulfate (another glycosaminoglycan), which is sometimes used in conjunction with glucosamine sulfate, may increase its efficacy. Literature for knee arthritis however, suggests that its results were no better than those of a placebo. Despite the mixed reviews, because it is a relatively benign treatment, it may be worth trying as one component of the non-operative management of mild to moderate arthritis. It may even be safe for those with shellfish allergies as the allergen is within the flesh of the animal, and glucosamine is derived from the shell.The typical dosage of glucosamine salt is 1500 mg per day. Dosage recommendations for glucosamine sulfate are set by the manufacturer, and vary widely because the amount of glucosamine present in 1500 mg of glucosamine salt depends on the anion present, and whether the manufacturer included other salts in their calculation.<br /><p>Edited October 17, 2015</p>
<h3>Summary</h3><br />Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) block the body's inflammatory response. The body's inflammatory response is generally a good thing; however, it does lead to an increase in pain for the effected area.  Inflammatory pain is often characterized by &quot;start-up&quot; pain - pain that occurs when you first get up in the morning or after you have been sitting and then get up. Taking Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) can lead to a noticeable short-term (6-8 hours) decrease in the pain associated with inflammation. However, NSAIDs will not address the underlying reason for the inflammatory response (ex. osteoarthritis, tendonitis, etc.) so they are effectively only masking the pain symptoms, not providing a permanent cure for the problem. Furthermore, there are many potential adverse reactions associated with NSAID use some of which are very serious, even fatal. Stomach ulcers, bleeding ulcers, increased risk of heart attack, kidney failure, increased bleeding, and a risk of bones and tissues not healing have all been associated with the use of NSAIDs. Patients with other risks factors for these conditions and older patients should NOT take NSAIDs.<br /><h3>Background information</h3><br />Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) are medications designed to decrease the body's inflammatory response. NSAIDs can be very effective in treating the pain associated with acute and chronic conditions which have an inflammatory component (i.e most conditions that produce pain). The body's inflammatory response is usually a good thing as it facilitates the healing of injured soft tissues and bones. However, in conditions that produce a low level of chronic tissue injury on a daily basis (ex. osteoarthritis, tendonitis) or conditions that are associated with an exuberant inflammatory response (ex. rheumatoid arthritis) this inflammatory response can lead to increased chronic pain. This inflammatory-type pain is often characterized by &quot;start-up&quot; pain. This is an increase in pain and stiffness that occurs after the involved joint or tendon has been immobile for a period of time. It explains why patients often have pain first thing in the morning when they get out of bed, or after they get up from sitting for a period of time. NSAIDs often can provide a substantial analgesic (pain relieving) effect by blocking the cylcooxygenase (COX) enzyme in the inflammatory pathway. This pathway produces prostaglandins which facilitate the inflammatory reaction. By blocking the production of prostaglandins the pain from the inflammatory response is decreased. However, the underlying reason for the inflammatory response (ex. osteoarthritis, tendonitis, etc.) is not addressed so NSAIDs will serve to mask the symptoms, but often do not provide a permanent cure for the problem. There seems to be relatively little difference in the clinical efficacy between various NSAIDs, although some patient may respond better to some NSAIDs than others.<br /><h3>Indications for use</h3><br />NSAIDs are typically used to treat both chronic and acute pain and inflammation. NSAIDs are most effective when used for short term treatment of acute injuries like minor strains and sprains. They can also be helpful for managing the symptoms associated with chronic conditions with an inflammatory component, like arthritis. Most NSAIDs are cleared from the body through the kidneys in about 6-8 hours.<br /><h3>Side effects of Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)</h3><br />The side effects associated with NSAIDs may limit their use in certain conditions and in certain patients.  Older patients, patients with a history of stomach problems, and patients with kidney problems often need to avoid taking NSAIDs do to potentially serious side effects. Conditions that require bone healing (ex. fractures) or are associate with increase bleeding (ex. many acute sprains and strains) may need to limit or avoid using NSAIDs as they may have an adverse effect on bone healing (an inflammatory process) and will tend to increase bleeding. Specific side effects include:<br /><ul><br />	<li><em>Stomach upset (Gastrointestinal Irritation):</em></li><br />	<li><em>Gastrointestinal (GI) Bleeding: </em>NSAIDs can lead to a bleeding stomach ulcer (the ulcer itself is actually in the duodenum, just past the stomach). This occurs because the NSAIDs block the production of prostanglandins which normally facilitate the secretion of a protective lining (mucosa) in the stomach. Without this lining the stomach acid is more likely to erode through the tissue and produce bleeding. This <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">bleeding can be sudden and potentially fatal, particularly in older individuals</span></em> who may not be able to tolerate a large blood loss. For this reason NSAIDs should be used with great caution, particularly in older patients:</li><br />	<li><em>Increased Risk of Heart Attack (Myocardial Infarction)</em>: Recent studies have suggested that use of NSAIDs in high dosages and COX-2 antatgonist (NSAIDs that only block the cyclooxygenase-2 enzyme) likely increase the risk of a heart attack by up to 80%.  Therefore patients with a previous heart attack, congestive heart failure, or significant risk factors for a heart attack (ex. positive family history) should avoid the use of NSAIDs.</li><br />	<li><em>Increased bleeding</em>: NSAIDs will tend to increase bleeding by indirectly inhibiting platelet function (platelets help form blood clots) which thereby increases the risk of bleeding.  The tendency to increase bleeding make NSAIDs less than ideal for treating many acute injury because of the potential to cause more bleeding and therefore, more swelling and pain. Patient that are undergoing elective surgery should stop their NSAID use about 10 days prior to surgery in order not to increase the risk of bleeding associated with the surgery.</li><br />	<li><em>Kidney Problems</em>: NSAIDs can lead to significant kidney problems even producing complete kidney failure.  This is due to their effect of decreasing blood flow to the kidneys (the effect of blocking the prostaglandin production). Kidney problems tend to occur more in patients with existing kidney problems or in patients who are taking high doses of NSAIDs over a longer period of time.</li><br />	<li><em>Bone Healing Problems</em>: NSAIDs can be very helpful at relieving pain associated with bone injuries such as fractures, or procedures that involve cutting or fusing bones. HOWEVER, as bone healing is fundamentally an inflammatory process by inhibiting this process there is an increase risk of the fracture or bone not healing leading to a non-union. To date, this limited bone healing response has been demonstrated in laboratory animals, but has not been confirmed in humans.</li><br />	<li><em>Photosensitivity</em>: NSAIDs may tend to make the skin more sensitive to sunlight.</li><br /></ul><br /><h2>Common NSAIDs Include:</h2><br /><p>ASA Acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin)<br />Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin)<br />Naproxen (Aleve)</p><br /><p>edited July 16th, 2014</p>
<h3>Summary</h3><br />Plasma can be extracted from a patient's blood and injected into an area of tendonitis, muscle injury, or ligament strain. The concentrated plasma contains a variety of growth factors including Platelet Derived Growth Factor (PDGF) and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) that have been shown in laboratory studies to enhance tissue healing and increase microciruclation to the involved area. PRP injections have been proposed as a means of stimulating healing for a variety of foot and ankle conditions including <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/achilles-tendinitis/">Achilles tendonitis</a></strong></em>, <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/achilles-tendon-rupture">Achilles tendon ruptures</a></strong></em>, <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/posterior-heel-pain">insertional Achilles tendonitis</a></strong></em>,<em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/peroneal-tendonitis">peroneal tendonitis</a></strong></em>, recalcitrant <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/plantar-fasciitis">plantar fasciitis</a></strong></em>, and <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/calf-muscle-tear-gastrocnemius-tear">calf muscle tears</a></strong></em>.<br />In theory this treatment makes sense. However, to date no clinical studies have been performed that demonstrate a clear advantage of PRP injections over the bodies normal healing response.<br /><h2>How is PRP harvested?</h2><br />Plasma Rich Protein is generated by taking a vial of a patient's blood and spinning it in a centrifuge. This separates the blood into layers based on the density of elements in the blood. The layers include: the red blood cells (heaviest layer); the &quot;Buffy Coat&quot; containing the plasma rich protein; and a plasma-poor layer (lightest layer). The plasma rich layer is isolated and then injected into the involved area under sterile conditions. If the injection is performed outside of the operating room it may be aided by ultrasound or fluroscopic x-rays to ensure that it is injected in the correct area.<br /><h3>Are there any potential complications associated with PRP injections?</h3><br />Any invasive procedure can be associated with potential complications! However, the complication rate associated with PRP injections appears to be very low. The main potential complication is the chance of an infection at the site of the injection. Reaction to the blood products has not been a problem because the patients own blood products are used so no cross reaction would be expected. One problem is the cost. This procedure is still considered experimental by most insurance companies so patients often have to pay out of their own pockets. This can be expensive as the equipment needed to prepare the blood can be expensive.<br /><p><span style="font-size: 10px;">Edited July 16th, 2014<br /></span></p>
<h2>Summary</h2><br />Viscosupplementation is a procedure in which a hyaluronic acid-based product is injected into an arthritic joint. Hyaluronic acid is a naturally occurring component of synovial fluid and articular cartilage. It is thought to play a role in joint lubrication and cartilage resilience, protecting the cartilage on a cellular level. Treatment typically consists of between three and five weekly injections into the affected joint. The effect of the treatment is quite variable. When it is successful, symptomatic improvement can last for up to a six months. Viscosupplementation is only recommended for patients for whom traditional non-operative treatment has been unsuccessful, and as an alternative to surgery. Our understanding of hyaluronic acid injections, including its exact mechanisms of action, are currently evolving.<br /><h2>What is hyaluronic acid?</h2><br />Hyaluronic acid, also called hyaluronan or hyaluronate, is a non-sulfated glycosaminoglycan. It is one of the chief components of the extracellular matrix (the non-cellular component of cartilage that makes up the vast majority of articular cartilage). It has been estimated that the average 70kg (154 lbs) person has roughly 15 grams of hyaluronic acid in their body, one-third of which is turned over (degraded and synthesized) every day.Hyaluronic acid serves a variety of important functions throughout the body, including playing a multifaceted role in the mediation of several cellular and matrix events in the process of skin tissue repair, and maintaining joint function. Hyaluronic acid is a major component and one of two natural lubricants found to increase the viscosity of synovial fluid.  Synovial fluid is the thick gel-like substance responsible for cushioning joints and providing lubrication to reduce joint friction. Hyaluronic acid is also present in a membrane around each cell (chondrocyte) of articular cartilage, which covers the ends of bones in a joint, contributing to its resilience. Additionally, the molecular weight and concentration of the naturally occurring hyaluronic acid decreases with age and at an accelerated rate for patients with osteoarthritis, decreasing the lubrication and protection of the joint tissues.<br />Hyluronic acid has been used to treat osteoarthritis through a series of hyaluronic acid-based injections into the joint cavity. These injections are thought to supplement the viscosity of the joint fluid (viscosupplementation), lubricating and cushioning the joint and producing an analgesic effect. It has also been suggested that hyaluronic acid has some direct positive biochemical effect on the cartilage cells.<br /><h2>When are hyaluronic acid injections indicated?</h2><br />Injection of hyaluronic acid may improve the symptoms associated with osteoarthritis, including pain, swelling, stiffness, and loss of motion. These symptoms are caused directly or indirectly by the breakdown and wear of the surface layer of cartilage and the loss of synovial fluid viscosity. Hyaluronic acid injection may be considered for patients with osteoarthritis (ex. ankle arthritis) for whom traditional nonsurgical management has proven ineffective. It may be offered either as an alternative to surgery, or for those patients who may not be candidates for surgery. The exact indications for viscosupplementation are still evolving.Unlike <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/non-operative-treatment/corticosteroid-injections/">corticosteroids</a></strong></em>, which produce a non-specific dampening of the inflammatory response, hyaluronic acid injections act specifically on the joint. Viscosupplementaion was first developed as treatment for knee arthritis.  However, it has since been applied to both the ankle and shoulder - and could theoretically be applied to any other joint affected by osteoarthritis.  However, it is important to note that the FDA has only approved hyluronic acid injections as a treatment for osteoarthritis of the knee. Use of hyluronic acid injections in other joints is therefore considered &quot;off label&quot; use, although this practice appears to be widespread. The exact mechanism of action of hyluronic acid is unclear, although restoring and increasing the viscosity of the synovial fluid and directly strengthening the cartilage seems to be the most logical explanations.Like <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/non-operative-treatment/corticosteroid-injections/"><em><strong>corticosteroids</strong></em></a>, hyaluronic acid injections do not work in the long term. The injected hyaluronic acid product stays within the joint space for anywhere from hours to days. Patients may see results for two months or four months or maybe even six months, but treatment does not change the underlying pathology. Although the procedure is in no way a cure, some patients may note long-term benefit because it may break the cycle of the arthritic pain. Patients with arthritis tend to limit their own joint movement because it is painful, but in doing so cause the muscles in the surrounding area to atrophy. This may have the effect of increasing their pain and further restricting their range of motion, thus continuing a pattern of decreased movement and increased pain. Although it does not address the underlying issue of the arthritis, for many patients viscosuplementaion may be a reasonable option.While many patients with osteoarthritis in the knee and ankle have noted positive results from hyaluronic acid injections, clinical studies of two hyaluronic acid products, hyaluronan and hylan G-F 20, have been equivocal and inconclusive. Because some placebo-controlled studies have cast doubt on its efficacy, it does not look to have been the cure-all panacea the medical community had hoped it would be.<br /><h2>How is the injection performed?</h2><br />The injection is carried out in the doctor's office. The skin is sterilized prior to the injection (usually with betadine or alcohol) and the needle is injected into the involved joint. Oftentimes, due to the significant cost of the product, the procedure is performed under fluoroscopy to ensure that the needle is accurately positioned within the joint. Fluoroscopy is an imaging technique commonly used by physicians to obtain real-time moving images of the internal structures of a patient, through the use of an x-ray source and a fluorescent screen. If effusion is present, aspiration of the joint is recommended before the injection to prevent dilution of the injected hyaluronic acid. Often, a local topical anesthetic or a small injection of lidocaine may be applied first to provide short term numbing of the area. The anesthetic typically wears off within a few hours. Injections are relatively easy to administer, take effect more rapidly than traditional anti-inflammatory medications, and avoid side effects that often accompany them, such stomach irritation.Three hyaluronic acid products are currently available in the United States: naturally occurring hyaluronan (Hyalgan), sodium hyaluronate (Supartz), and synthetic hylan G-F 20 (Synvisc). The recommended injection schedule is one injection per week for five weeks for Hyalgan and Supartz, and one injection per week for three weeks for Synvisc. Repeat courses of viscosupplementation can be performed after six months, if the patients experience positive results.Because hyaluronic acid has contradictory duo-functions in the inflammatory process, playing a significant role in both its stimulation and moderation, <em>it is common for patients to experience worsening symptoms over the next few days before noticing improvement.</em> Patients should avoid any strenuous activities or prolonged (more than 1 hour) weight-bearing activities (such as jogging or tennis) for 48 hours following the injection.Oral use of hyaluronan has recently been suggested, and its effectiveness is currently being tested in preliminary clinical studies.<br /><h2><em><strong>Potential Risks of Hyaluronic Acid Injections</strong></em></h2><br />Potential complications include risk of infection at the injection site, which could be very serious if it goes directly into the ankle joint. Besides the inherent danger, history of infection is a contraindication for certain procedures like ankle replacement. Other reasons patients think twice about the procedure are the expense, and the short term nature of the effects. Results vary from person to person and typically last from two to six months, but in no case is the injection a longterm cure. Some people have inflammatory reactions to the injection, due to hyaluronic acids complex role in the inflammatory process, and find that in the short term, they feel even worse off than before.The cost of hyaluronic acid is significant. According to the 1999 issue of the Red Book, a pharmacological reference guide of pricing and product information, the average wholesale price for five vials of Hyalgan is $661.00, and a package of three prefilled syringes of Synvisc is $620.00. Today, the cost of Supartz is between $300 and $400. The United States Food and Drug Administration classifies viscosupplements as a device, not a drug. Medicare and private insurance typically reimburse the cost of devices and procedures that are medically necessary to treat your condition, and are used according to the labeled uses approved by the FDA. However, the FDA has currently only approved injections for the knee, although they are being studied for use in joints of the shoulder, hip, and ankle.<br /><p>Edited October 10th, 2015</p>
<h2>Excess weight: the importance of weight loss</h2><br />Many chronic foot problems (ex. tendonitis, stress fractures, arthritis, etc.) are caused by, or aggravated by, increased force absorbed by the foot during each step. The foot absorbs 2-3 times body weight during each step while walking, and 4-5 times body weight during running or other &quot;high impact&quot; activities. These forces are many times body weight because the foot acts like a lever (when the heel comes off the ground) to magnify the forces that the structures in the foot are subject to.To minimize these forces, and thereby hopefully decrease symptoms or slow the progression of chronic injuries, there are a few things that can be done. Comfort shoes can help provide shock-absorbing capacity and allow for the smooth dispersion of forces up the leg. Walking and running on softer surfaces (i.e avoiding concrete and pavement) can also help to limit the forces that the structures of the feet are exposed to. However, it is most important to maintain an optimal body weight!<br /><h2>What is optimal body weight?</h2><br />Optimal body weight varies from person to person. However, in general a patient should strive to maintain a normal <em><strong><a href="/body-mass-index-bmi">Body Mass Index</a></strong></em> (BMI), which is between 18.5 and 25. Patients with a BMI &gt; 30 are considered obese, whereas patients with a BMI &gt; 40 are considered morbidly obese. Lowering your BMI into the normal range can often have a dramatic effect on foot symptoms!<br /><h2>Strategies for Weight Loss!</h2><br />Weight Loss requires burning more calories than are taken in by eating. Therefore an appropriate diet to limit calories combined with a regular exercise program to burn off calories, is critical for weight loss. You should strive to work out for at least 20-30 minutes 4 times per week.<br /><h3>Diet</h3><br />An appropriate diet would include regular small meals that include fruits and/or vegetables, combined with the elimination of high calorie deserts, snacks, and drinks.<br /><h3>Exercise</h3><br />Many common forms of exercise, such as walking and running, are NOT appropriate for patients with serious foot problems because they will increase the loading through the foot and thereby increase symptoms. Regular &quot;low impact&quot; exercises such as cycling, swimming, or water aerobics are preferable:<br /><ul><br />	<li><strong><em>Cycling. </em></strong>Use of an exercise bike is an excellent way to burn off calories without excessively stressing your feet. When using an exercise bike, generally about 50% or your body weight goes through your feet (unless you are standing &quot;out of the saddle&quot;) which is substantially less than the 4-5x body experienced by the feet when running. In general, a low resistance setting and a high RPM is the best way to burn off calories without excessively loading your feet. Care must be taken to ensure that your seat height is positioned correctly, as a poorly positioned seat can lead to knee symptoms. As a generalization, most novice cyclist have their seats positioned too low. Your knee should be slightly bent when you toe is on the pedal at the bottom of the pedal stroke.</li><br />	<li><em><strong>Swimming. </strong></em>Swimming is an excellent way to burn off calories without putting much strain on the feet. If kicking in the pool aggravates your foot condition, you may consider swimming with a Pull-Buoy between your legs to eliminate the use of your feet altogether.</li><br />	<li><em><strong>Water Aerobics. </strong></em>Placing a life vest on and getting in a swimming pool allows an individual to perform a variety of exercises aimed at stretching, strengthening, and building aerobic fitness. Simply &quot;running in the pool&quot; can be an excellent form of exercise.</li><br /></ul><br /> <br /><p>Edited October 17, 2015</p><br /><p></p>
<p>Patients undergoing surgical procedures on their feet may encounter any of the following post surgical issues:</p><br /><p><em><strong><a href="#confusion">Confusion</a></strong></em><br /><em><strong><a href="#constipation">Constipation</a></strong></em><br /><em><strong><a href="#hiccups">Hiccups</a></strong></em><br /><em><strong><a href="#heelpain">Heel Pain</a></strong></em><br /><em><strong><a href="#driving">Driving</a></strong></em><br /><em><strong><a href="#fever">Fever</a></strong></em><br /><em><strong><a href="#mobilizing">Mobilizing Post Foot Surgery</a></strong></em><br /><em><strong><a href="#nausea">Nausea and Vomiting</a></strong></em><br /><em><strong><a href="/pain-control-post-surgery">Pain Control Post-Surgery</a></strong></em><br /><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/preparing-for-foot-surgery-what-should-i-do">Preparing Your Home For Post-Surgical Recovery</a></strong></em><br /><em><strong><a href="#safety">Safety Post-Surgery</a></strong></em></p><h2><a name="confusion"></a>Confusion</h2><br />Patients who undergo a general anesthetic may be disoriented while awakening from the anesthetic, as well as for a period of time afterwards.  This may last anywhere from less than 10 minutes to a few hours.  During this time, the patient may have associated amnesia.  For example, if your surgeon speaks to you immediately after surgery you may have no recollection of the discussion.Confusion related to the anesthetic is often due to the anesthetic gases and narcotics that are given during the operation.  It can sometimes take anywhere from a few hours or longer for these metabolites to &quot;clear&quot; a person's system after surgery.  During this time, confusion can be common.  There may be increased confusion in some overweight patients, since it may take longer for the &quot;fat soluble&quot; anesthetics to clear their system.A small percentage of patients will either stay confused or become confused in the first day or two after surgery.  When this happens, a cause needs to be identified. The most common cause of confusion is medication that the patient receives during anesthesia or in the recovery process. Often the narcotics that are given to help control post-operative pain will induce some confusion.<br /><h2><a name="constipation"></a>Constipation</h2><br />Constipation is a common problem after surgery.  It often takes about 3-5 days to manifest. Constipation occurs because patients are given narcotics to control their post-operative pain.  Narcotic medication slow the motility of the bowel. Also, events that usually stimulate your bowel, such as eating and being active, are constrained. Treatment includes taking a stool softener daily after the surgery.  Laxatives can be added if stool softeners are ineffective.<br /><h2><a name="hiccups"></a>Hiccups</h2><br />Fortunately, hiccups are not that common after surgery. Generally hiccups occur due to irritation of the diaphragm - a muscular area that separates your lungs from your abdomen. Occasionally, the combination of taking medications and laying down (supine) can cause patients to develop hiccups. Hiccups are self limiting and will usually settle on their own.<br /><h2><a name="heelpain"></a>Heel Pain</h2><br />Heel pain is a common complaint 6-12 weeks after major foot or ankle surgery. The pain is usually self-limiting. There can be a couple of causes, but the most common is that the heel tissue gets irritated when a person begins to increase their walking and general weight-bearing after being off their foot for an extended period of time, recovering from the surgery. The heel becomes accustom to not being walked on during the time the patient is &quot;non-weightbearing&quot; (often 6-10 weeks). The heel tissue atrophies a bit during this time and does not appreciate the relatively sudden increase in activity that occurs when patient start weightbearing again. The heel often lets the patient know that it is angry with this increased workload by becoming symptomatic with pain and irritation. The solution in this instance is to slow down the recovery a bit and to realize that the heel symptoms will get better (usually in 3-6 weeks) - once the heel tissue toughen ups a bit.The other potential cause of heel pain following surgery is pain from a prominent screw head (hardware). If this is the case, it can be padded (heel gel pad from a local drug store) but ultimately the screw will need to be removed once the bone has healed.<br /><h2><a name="driving"></a>Driving</h2><br />Driving must be avoided for a period of time after many foot surgeries.  <em><strong>Driving is an activity where safety is paramount</strong></em>, so any activity that effects the safe operation of the vehicle should be avoided.  Therefore it is critical that patients NOT drive right after a major surgery.  Patients who undergo surgery on their right foot, or patients who have a manual transmission will have to avoid driving for a prolonged period of time.  For major surgery, such as an ankle fracture, this is often 10 weeks or more.  Patients should not return to driving until they have been cleared by their surgeon. Once comfortable, patients should ease back into driving, and if driving skills are of a concern after surgery, a driving class should be considered. Patients should never drive with a walking boot or any other device that restricts their motion.<br /><h2><a name="fever"></a>Fever</h2><br />A low grade fever which is below 38.5 C (101.3 F) within the first 2 to 3 days after surgery is surprisingly common. The most common cause of a low grade fever after surgery is a condition called atelectasis. Atelectasis occurs when your lungs do not fully expand, causing the base of the lungs to clump up a bit.  This tends to occur in situations where a patient is lying down and not taking deep breaths - both common situations after foot surgery. Treatment of atelectasis involves taking a full deep breath a couple of times every hour to help expand your lungs. Patients should also be encouraged to get out of bed and sitting upright so gravity can assist in expanding the lungs. A low grade fever may last until the atelectasis is gone.Patients should always be concerned about a fever in the post-operative period, however they should be particularly concerned if the fever:<br /><ul><br />	<li>occurs more than three days after surgery</li><br />	<li>is quite high - above 38.5 C (101.3 F)</li><br />	<li>is associated with intense pain at the site of surgery</li><br />	<li>is associated with other other symptoms (e.g. chest pain, abdominal pain, urinary tract infections)</li><br /></ul><br />These situations may be associated with an infection or other potentially serious medical problem.<br /><h2><a name="mobilizing"></a>Mobilizing</h2><br />All foot surgery creates some initial pain that will make walking and moving around challenging. After surgery, depending upon the type of operation that was done, the surgeon will allow patients to have one of three limitations:<br /><ol><br />	<li>Weight bearing as tolerated;</li><br />	<li>Non weight bearing, or</li><br />	<li>Partial weight bearing.</li><br /></ol><br /><h3>Weight Bearing as Tolerated</h3><br />For surgeries that do not require major bone, tendon, or ligament healing, the surgeon may deem it acceptable to bear full weight on the operated foot.  However, even though patients may be allowed to weightbear as tolerated, it is still important to continue to wear appropriate footwear and minimize the amount of time that the foot is down (elevate the foot).  Footwear, such as a post operative shoe or a <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/cam-walker-walking-boot">Cam Walker</a></strong></em>, is designed to protect the surgical area by evenly dispersing force up the leg, thereby helping to protect the operated area. It is also important to limit walking. Walking will cause more swelling to the operated area than is there already, which will created increased discomfort. Also, patients will often limp after surgery. A limp creates an <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#asymmetric-gait">asymmetric gait</a></strong></em> and therefore too much walking will often lead to overload of other parts of the body with resulting symptoms (e.g. lower back pain, knee pain, kip pain).<br /><h3>Non-Weight Bearing</h3><br />For many operations that require healing of major bones, tendons, or ligaments, your surgeon will instruct you to be non-weight bearing. Sometimes patient will be allowed to be touchdown weight bearing (i.e. letting the foot gently rest on the ground - 10-15 lbs of weight). No or limited weight bearing through the foot is done with the use of <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/crutches">crutches</a></strong></em>, walker, <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/knee-walker">knee walker</a></strong></em>, or wheelchair. If instructed to be non-weight bearing, it is <em>critical</em> that patients remain non-weight bearing until their surgeon instructs them otherwise, since loading through a healing bone or ligament may cause inappropriate tissue healing or lead to non-unions of bones or fusions.<br /><h3>Partial Weight Bearing</h3><br />Some surgical procedures, particularly around the front and mid part of the foot (e.g. some bunion procedures), can be treated with partial weight bearing. Weight bearing can be done through the heel while using <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/crutches">crutches</a></strong></em> or other devices that limit the weight through the foot. It may be important not to load through a part of the foot (ex. the front of the foot) as this may disrupt the healing process.If <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/crutches">crutches are used, they should be fitted properly</a></strong></em>. In addition, many people will find that <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/knee-walker">knee walkers</a></strong></em> are helpful since it allows patients to apply weight though the knee and not the foot. It's also important to keep the foot elevated at or above the level of the heart, minimizing swelling that naturally occurs after a major foot surgery. It is very important that patients follow surgeons' recommendations. If recommendations are not followed, patients are likely to have increased swelling, increased pain, and an increased risk of non-union.<br /><h2><a name="nausea"></a>Nausea</h2><br />Unfortunately, nausea and vomiting are a relatively common side effect of surgery. The most common cause immediately after sugery is related to the reaction of the anesthetic agent. However, some of the narcotic pain medications that are given to treat post-operative pain may cause nausea and vomiting. The main treatment for nausea and vomiting is to remove the cause if possible. For example, if patients are sensitive to narcotics, then they may, if possible, limit their narcotic use or switch to another narcotic that is less sensitive. Another option for treating nausea is to take an anti-nausea medication (antiemitic), such as diphenhydramine (Benadryll).<br /><h2><a name="safety"></a>Safety</h2><br />Moving around after surgery can be difficult and may place patients in an increased risk of falling, which can injure another area of the body. Also, if patients are on pain medication, the chances of falling also increases. Therefore, it is important to limit activity and be very careful when mobilizing after foot surgery.<br /><p><br />Edited November 16, 2015</p>
<p>There are a number of ways that post-operative pain can be managed. You will likely need to use a combination of the following strategies:</p>

<p><a name="Post-Operative-Nerve-Blocks"></a></p>
<h3>Post-Operative Nerve Blocks</h3>
<p><a name="Post-Operative-Nerve-Blocks"></a><br />
Many anesthesiologist or surgeons will perform local (nerves around the operative site) or peripheral (nerves leading to the operative site) nerve blocks. This is similar to what the dentist does when fixing a cavity. It can leave your foot numb in the short term after surgery. However, it can be very helpful in the hours immediately after surgery and can really minimize the amount fo pain medication that is required immediately after surgery. Depending on the type of &quot;nerve block&quot; the local freezing may last from 3 hours to 15 hours (or longer)<br />
<a name="Narcotic-Pain-Medication"></a></p>
<h3>Narcotic Pain Medication</h3>
<p><a name="Narcotic-Pain-Medication"></a></p>
<p><a name="Narcotic-Pain-Medication"></a><br />
Narcotic pain medication is often prescribed after surgery. It can be very helpful at managing pain but does have side effects. There are many different types of narcotic pain medication (ex. Vicoden, Percocet, Norco, Tylenol #3). Most are short acting and will last for 4-6 hours therefore they need to be taken regularly to achieve their effect. It is important that you take enough pain medication to stay ahead of severe pain. Some pain medications (ex. Oxycontin) are long acting and therefore only need to be taken 2-3 times per day. Side effects of pain medication can include: nausea and vomiting, confusion (or feeling &quot;weird&quot;), constipation, and the potential for addiction.<br />
<a name="NSAIDs"></a></p>
<h3>Anti-Inflammatory Pain Medication (NSAIDs)</h3>
<p><a name="NSAIDs"></a></p>
<p><a name="NSAIDs"></a><br />
Anti-inflammatory medication (ex. Ibuprofen, Advil, Motrin, Aleve, Voltaren, etc.) can be a helpful additional means of managing post-operative foot pain.  However, anti-inflammatory medications may have an adverse effect on bone, tendon, and ligament healing so consult your doctor before taking anti-inflammatory medications regularly to help manage your post-operative pain.  In addition NSAIDs can have significant side effects such as stomach irritation, ulcers, or bleeding; or kidney problems.<br />
<a name="foot-elevation"></a></p>
<h3>Foot Elevation</h3>
<p><a name="foot-elevation"></a></p>
<p><a name="foot-elevation"></a><br />
Keeping your foot elevated 6-18 inches above your heart can be very helpful at minimizing swelling and therefore decreasing post-operative pain. The best way to elevate your foot in this way is to lie on abed or sofa with one or two pillows under the foot.<br />
<a name="activity-modification"></a></p>
<h3>Activity Modification</h3>
<p><a name="activity-modification"></a></p>
<p><a name="activity-modification"></a><br />
It is critical to avoid activities that will require you to have your foot dangling down for any significant period of time in the early post-operative period.  Therefore avoid shopping excursions or other activities where you will be standing for any length of time in the first few weeks after surgery.<br />
<a name="ice"></a></p>
<h2>Ice</h2>
<p><a name="ice"></a></p>
<p><a name="ice"></a><br />
Ice placed in a plastic bag or a package of frozen vegetables can be very helpful at controlling post-operative pain. Ice should be applied for 10-15 minutes at a time and then removed for 10-15 minutes. Ice should NEVER be used when the foot is numb from a nerve block as this can easily lead to frostbite. If a cast or a thick dressing is in place this may diminish the effect of the ice as less cooling will get to the operated area. Ice works in part by constricting the small blood vessels around the foot and ankle and thereby decreasing the blood flow to the area. There are commercially available ice pumps that can be helpful, but should again NEVER be used if the foot or ankle is numb.</p>

Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/gwyneth-devries-md-frcsc-editor/">Gwyneth deVries, MD, FRCSC</a></strong></em><br /><h2>Summary</h2><br />An accessory navicular bone is a common finding on many foot x-rays. Most accessory naviculars are asymptomatic. However, in some patients, the prominent bone on the inside of the foot will create discomfort, which leads to difficulty with shoe fitting. Alternatively, the fibrous union between the navicular bone and the &quot;extra&quot; accessory part may become irritated and cause discomfort. Diagnosis is completed through physical examination and plain x-rays of the foot. Treatment is usually non-operative, often including a change in shoe wear and activity modification. However, patients that have ongoing symptoms once non-surgical treatments are tried, often consider surgery to remove the prominent accessory navicular and, if necessary, reattach the posterior tibial tendon.<br /><h5>Figure 1:  Normal Navicular compared to &quot;Accessory&quot; Navicular</h5><br />^media_display_589c2931de9125bcb7692fbc/position:center^<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />Many people have accessory (&quot;extra&quot;) naviculars (figure 1) - a prominent extra bone extending from the navicular bone. Most accessory naviculars are completely asymptomatic. However, some individuals will develop pain on the inside of their midfoot. Pain may occur from the pressure of the shoewear against the prominence, irritating either the bone itself or the fibrous junction where the accessory bone meets the regular navicular. Alternatively, the fibrous junction or interface may become painful as a result of tension applied by the posterior tibial tendon through its connection or insertion at that site.  Often, individuals will be asymptomatic for years, however, a new pair of shoes or a change in their activity level can cause symptoms. The accessory navicular itself typically develops during adolescence, when the two areas of the navicular bone fail to fuse together. Upon examining a foot with a symptomatic accessory navicular, there will often be a bony prominence on the inside of the foot, just below and in front of the inside ankle bone (medial malleolus). The size of this prominence will vary from small to quite large. Pressing over this area will often cause discomfort. There may be an associated flat foot deformity as this can occur in patients with an accessory navicular. Stressing the posterior tibial tendon by raising the heel up and down on one foot, or by forcing the foot to the inside against resistance, may aggravate the symptoms as these maneuvers stress the posterior tibial tendon which is attached on the inside of the accessory navicular bone. Patients may walk with a slight limp due to the pain.<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />Plain x-rays are used to determine the size of the accessory navicular. There are three main types of accessory navicular bones:  a small bone embedded within the nearby posterior tibial tendon; a triangular shaped bone connected to the navicular by thick cartilage; and a large prominent navicular tuberosity thought to represent an accessory navicular that has fused to the navicular. If the status of the posterior tibial tendon needs to be assessed or if other problems are suspected, (ex. <em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/navicular-stress-fracture/">Navicular stress fracture</a></em>) it may be necessary to perform an MRI. Although this is not considered routine, an MRI may be helpful in identifying the degree of irritation. An MRI would demonstrate fluid or edema that may accumulate in the bone as a result of the irritation.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br /><h3>Non-Operative Treatment</h3><br />Many individuals with symptomatic accessory naviculars can be managed successfully without surgery. Standard non-surgical treatment includes:<br /><h4>Appropriate <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/comfort-shoes">Comfortable Shoes</a></strong></em></h4><br />Shoes that are soft around the inside of the ankle can allow for any excess prominence of bone. Therefore, it is recommended that either shoes with plenty of padding and space in the ankle area are purchased, or pre-owned shoes can be modified by a shoemaker to create extra space in this area. For example, many patients will get their ski boots expanded in the area around the prominence, minimizing irritation. In addition, a shoe with a stiff sole will help disperse force away from the arch of the foot during walking, thereby minimizing the force on the posterior tibial tendon.  An off-the-shelf arch support may help decrease the stress applied by the posterior tibial tendon.  If necessary, an ankle brace applied to provide more substantial support to the arch may be successful where a simple arch support fails.<br /><h4>Application of local padding</h4><br />Often applying local foam or gel padding can help improve symptoms. Both can be purchased at many pharmacies.<br /><h4><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/activity-modification">Activity Modification</a></strong></em></h4><br />If symptoms have been aggravated by an increase in activity level, backing off on activities in the short term can be helpful. The foot is subject to a lot of repetitive loading during walking, and therefore minimizing this force will often help symptoms to settle. After symptoms have settled, the activity level can then be gradually increased.<br /><h4><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/weight-loss">Weight Loss</a></strong></em></h4><br />Excess weight will increase the force on the posterior tibial tendon as it inserts into the accessory navicular and will tend to precipitate or aggravate symptoms. If a patient with a symptomatic accessory navicular is overweight, then losing weight can be very helpful. Even losing 5-10lbs will decrease the amount of force going through the foot with each step by as much as 15-30lbs. This is because the foot acts like a lever serving to magnify the force absorbed by the foot with each step.<br /><h3>Operative Treatment</h3><br />If non-operative treatment fails to relieve the patient’s symptoms, surgical intervention may be warranted. The standard operative treatment of an accessory navicular is a Kidner procedure.  However, if surgery is undertaken it is important that it address the underlying source of the patients pain.  Surgical treatment may include:<br /><h4>Modified Kidner Procedure (Resection of the Prominent Accessory Navicular)</h4><br />The Kidner procedure involves resecting the prominent accessory navicular and ensuring that the posterior tibial tendon is still attached to the bone. Often the prominent bone can simply be shelled out from its position relative to the posterior tibial tendon, which leaves the tendon intact. However, if the tendon is loose and floppy once the extra bone has been removed, suturing or together is required as a means of attaching it into the remaining navicular bone.<br /><h4>Kidner Procedure</h4><br />In the original Kidner procedure, the entire posterior tibial tendon was released from the navicular and then rerouted through a drill hole placed through the navicular. The original Kidner procedure is now rarely used as a means of treating an isolated accessory navicular. Instead, a modification of the Kidner procedure has become more commonplace.  The modified Kidner procedure consists of carefully removing the accessory and anchoring the posterior tibial tendon to the surface of the navicular where the accessory was removed.  The repair may be done by passing a suture through the tendon and then through drill holes in the navicular, or by using a suture anchor.<br /><h4>Fusion of the Accessory Navicular to the Navicular</h4><br />Fusion of the accessory navicular to the navicular with screws is required when there is a large accessory navicular bone and removal of this bone would reduce the articular surface of the Navicular to the talus (coxa pedis). Fusion will relieve pain without disrupting the tibialis posterior tendon insertion nor narrowing talar head support.RecoveryIn most instances, a patient's recovery will be as follows: <em>0-6 weeks</em>: Immobilization (in case or cast boot) non-weight-bearing or touch weight-bearing <em>6-10 weeks</em>: Increasing activity in a cast boot. Physical therapy to work on strength and balance Full recovery after 9 weeks-2 months In some patients (where the posterior tibial tendon is still intact and functioning) the treating surgeon may allow weight-bearing as tolerated in a cast boot immediately after surgery.<br /><p align="right">Edited on November 18, 2016 (Originally edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/jean-brilhault-md-editor/">Jean Brilhault, MD</a>, </strong></em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/michael-castro-do-editor"><strong><em>Michael Castro, DO</em></strong></a>)</p>
Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/timothy-charlton-md-editor/" target="_blank">Tim Charlton, MD</a></strong></em><br /><h2>Summary</h2><br />Achilles tendon ruptures commonly occur in athletic individuals in their 30s, 40s, and early 50s while performing activities that require sudden acceleration or changes in direction (ex. basketball, tennis, etc.). Patients usually describe a sharp pain in their heel region almost as if they were &quot;struck in the back of the leg&quot;. The diagnosis of an acute Achilles tendon rupture is made on clinical examination as x-rays will reveal the ankle bones to be normal. The Achilles is the largest and strongest tendon in the body (figure 1). It is subject to 2-3 times body weight during normal walking so regaining normal Achilles tendon function is critical. Achilles tendon ruptures can be successfully treated non-operatively, or operatively --but they must be formally treated. Recent studies suggest that non-surgical and surgical treatment of Achilles tendon ruptures produce equivalent results.  Surgical treatment may lead to a slightly faster recovery and a lower rate of re-rupture. However, surgery can be associated with very serious complications such as an infection or wound healing problems. For this reason non-operative treatment may be preferable in many individuals, especially those patients with diabetes, vascular disease, and those who are long-term smokers.<br /><h5>Figure 1:  Achilles Tendon</h5><br />^media_display_589c2932de9125bcb7692fc0/position:center^<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />The Achilles tendon is the largest and strongest tendon in the body (Figure 1). It functions to help control the foot when walking and running. Ruptures of the Achilles tendon commonly occur in individuals in their 30s, 40s, and early 50s. This age group is affected because these patients are still quite active, but over time their tendons tend to become stiffer and gradually weaken.  These ruptures usually occur when an athlete loads the Achilles in preparation to pushing off.  This can occur when suddenly changing directions, starting to run, or preparing to jump (Figure 2).  These ruptures occur because the calf muscle generates tremendous force through the Achilles tendon in the process of propelling the body.  Patients will feel a sharp intense pain in the back of their heel. Patients often initially think that they were &quot;struck in the back of the heel&quot; and then realize that there was no one around them. After the injury, patients will have some swelling. If they can walk at all, it will be with a marked limp.  It is very rare that a rupture of the Achilles is partial. However, a painful <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/achilles-tendinitis/">Achilles tendonitis</a></strong></em> or a <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/calf-muscle-tear-gastrocnemius-tear">partial rupture of the calf muscle</a></strong></em> (gastrocnemius) as it inserts into the Achilles can also cause pain in this area.  The pain of an Achilles rupture can subside quickly and this injury may be misdiagnosed in the Emergency Department as a sprain.<br /><h5>Figure 2:  Mechanism of Injury - Sudden Change of Direction to Maximal Achilles Load</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Figure-2-Achilles-Tendon-Rupture-Mechanism-of-Injury-Sudden-Change-of-Direction-leading-to-Maximal-Achilles-load.png">^media_display_589c2934de9125bcb7692fc3/position:center^</a><br /><h5>Figure 3: Achilles Maximum Load during walking - Heel Rise</h5><br />^media_display_589c2935de9125bcb7692fc6/position:center^<br /><h2>Physical Examination</h2><br />The diagnosis of an Achilles tendon rupture is made entirely on physical examination. Often, there is a substantial defect in the Achilles 2-5 cm before it inserts into the heel bone. However, the main test is to determine whether the Achilles has been ruptured is the Thompson test. This essentially involves placing the patient on their stomach and squeezing the calf muscle. If the Achilles is intact, the foot will rise [plantar flex]. If it is ruptured, the foot will not move and will tend to be in a lower lying position.Some patients mistakenly believe the tendon is working if they can push the foot down, however, patients will usually be able to move the foot up and down while sitting because the other surrounding muscles and tendons are still intact. Trying to push up while standing and applying body weight to the foot will reveal the true weakness. It will be difficult or impossible for a patient to stand on their toes for any length of time if they have suffered an Achilles tendon rupture -this is called the STAMP test. Sensation and circulation to the foot and ankle will be normal. This is quite rare, occurring in only a small fraction of patients with Achilles injuries. Patients suffering this type of Achilles avulsion injury tend to be older with weaker bone.<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />Plain x-rays will be negative in patients who have suffered an Achilles tendon rupture unless the Achilles injury involves pulling off (avulsion) part of the heel bone (calcaneus). The rupture can be seen on ultrasound or MRI. However, these studies are not indicated for acute ruptures unless there is some uncertainty about the diagnosis. For chronic problems of the Achilles or ruptures that are old, an MRI may be very helpful.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br />Achilles tendon ruptures can be treated non-operatively or operatively. Both of these treatment approaches have advantages and disadvantages. Recent studies suggest that non-surgical and surgical treatment of Achilles tendon ruptures produce equivalent results. However, the decision of how an Achilles tendon rupture should be treated needs to be based on each individual patient after the advantages and disadvantages of both treatment options have been reviewed. <b>It is important to realize that while Achilles tendon ruptures can be treated either non-operatively or operatively, they must be treated.</b> A neglected Achilles tendon rupture (i.e. one where the tendon ends are not kept opposed) will lead to marked problems of the leg in walking, which may eventually lead to other limb and joint problems. Furthermore, late reconstruction of non-treated Achilles tendon rupture is significantly more complex than timely treatment.<br /><h3>Non-Operative Treatment</h3><br />Non-operative treatment of an Achilles tendon rupture consists of placing the foot in a downward position [equinus] and providing relative immobilization of the foot in this position until the Achilles has healed. This typically involves some type of stable bracing in a <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/foot-and-ankle-medical-supplies/cam-walker-walking-boot/">walker boot</a> with a heel lift. More aggressive rehabilitation programs for patients undergoing non-operative treatment may allow for graduated weight-bearing in the early phase of the recovery, however, it is often 6 weeks before full weight bearing in a boot or brace is allowed. In general newer rehabilitation protocols allow for earlier movement of the healing tendon while protecting it from significant loads that would cause the healing tendon to disrupt or stretch out.  It is very important that the status of the Achilles is monitored throughout non-operative treatment. This can be done by physical examination or via ultrasound.  If there is evidence of gapping or non-healing, surgery may need to be considered. Formal protocols have been developed to help optimize non-operative treatments and excellent results have been reported with these protocols. The focus of these treatments is to ensure that the Achilles rupture is in continuity and is healing in a satisfactory manner while at the same time preserving the function of the calf muscle.The primary advantage of non-operative treatment is that without an incision in this area, there are no problems with wound healing or infection. Wound infection following Achilles tendon surgery can be a devastating complication and therefore, for many patients, especially those patients with <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/diabetes/">diabetes</a>, vascular disease, and patients who are long-term smokers, non-operative treatment should be contemplated.The main disadvantage of non-operative treatment is that the recovery is probably a bit slower. On average, the main checkpoints of recovery occur 2-4 weeks quicker with operative treatment than with non-operative treatment. In addition, the re-rupture rate appears to be higher with some non-operative treatments. Re-rupture typically occurs 8-18 months after the original injury.<br /><h3>Operative Treatment</h3><br />Operative treatment of Achilles tendon ruptures involves opening the skin and identifying the torn tendon. This is then sutured together to create a stable construct. This can be performed through a standard Achilles tendon repair technique or through a mini-incision technique (to read about the different types of techniques, look under &quot;Procedure&quot; in <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/achilles-tendon-repair">Achilles Tendon Repair</a></strong></em>). By suturing the torn tendon ends together, they maintain continuity and can be mobilized more quickly.  However, it is critical to understand that the return to normal activities must wait until adequate healing of the tendon has occurred.The potential advantages of an open repair of the Achilles tendon include:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><i>Faster recovery:</i> Operative repair of an Achilles tendon rupture may allow for a slightly faster recovery.</li><br /> 	<li><i>Early Range of Motion:</i> Patients are able to move the ankle earlier so it is easier to regain motion and the rehabilitation program can be more aggressive.</li><br /> 	<li><i>Lower Re-rupture Rate:</i> The re-rupture rate may be significantly lower in operatively treated patients (2-5%) compared to patients treated non-operatively (8-12%).</li><br /></ul><br />The main disadvantage of an open repair of the Achilles tendon rupture is the potential for a wound-healing problem which could lead to a deep infection that is difficult to eradicate, or a painful scar.<br /><h3>Rehabilitation of Achilles Tendon Ruptures</h3><br />When compared to the traditional treatment of casting and immobilization for a minimum of 6 weeks a protocol of rehabilitation exercises (combined with specific instructions for weight bearing and bracing) leads to improved recovery whether the injury is treated with surgery or not.The outline for the exercises, bracing, and weight-bearing for the treatment of Achilles tendon ruptures is as follows (adapted from Willets et al, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery (JBJS) 2011):<i>Week 0-2</i><br />The ankle is braced at 20 degrees of plantar flexion (or a 2 cm lift is placed under the heel in a boot-type brace). No weight is placed on the foot.  In the case of surgery, a wound check will occur in this interval.<i>Week 2-4</i><br />The ankle remains braced in plantar flexion. Exercises begin, several times per day out of the brace.  The exercises consist of gentle up and down motion of the ankle, taking care not to stretch the Achilles tendon past neutral (90 degrees). Also, inversion and eversion of the ankle is performed, again with the ankle in slight plantarflexion.<i>Week 4-6</i><br />Increased weight-bearing is permitted. The exercises continue as above, and the brace is still worn day and night.<i>Week 6-8</i><br />The heel lift is removed and brace wear continues. Exercises progress, with slow stretching of the tendon past 90 degrees. Some strengthening of the calf occurs with the addition of resistance exercises.<i>Week 8-12</i><br />The brace is gradually weaned, using crutches as needed. Range of motion, strength, and proprioception are gradually optimized.<strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/ACHILLES-TENDON-RUPTURE-Handout-01-17-2017.pdf">Click here</a></strong> <strong>for a summary handout on Achilles Tendon Ruptures</strong> <br /><p>Edited on January 17, 2017</p>
Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/matthew-buchanan-md-editor/">Matthew Buchanan, MD</a></strong></em><br /><h2>Summary</h2><br />Achilles tendonitis is characterized by pain and swelling in the Achilles tendon. Non-Insertional Achilles tendonitis (occurring above the insertion) is often associated with an increase in activity level and tends to occur in patients in their 30s and 40s. Treatment is usually non-operative and includes an initial period where the symptoms are allowed to settle, followed by a gradual return to activity.  Treatment includes: avoiding aggravating activities; use of a slight heel lift inside the shoe; wearing a shoe with a heel to off-load the tendon; anti-inflammatory medications (if tolerated); and exercises designed to both stretch and strengthen the Achilles tendon.<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />There are four common causes for pain in region near the back part of the heel:<br /><ol><br /> 	<li><em>Paratenonitis:</em> - Inflammation of the sheath surrounding the Achilles tendon, rather than of the tendon itself.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Non insertional Achilles tendonitis</em>: - In this, type the pathology is typically located  2-6cm above the insertion of the Achilles tendon to the heel bone.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Insertional Achilles tendonitis</em>: - In this type, the pathology is located at the insertion of the Achilles tendon to the heel bone.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Achilles tendon rupture</em>: - Rupture of the Achilles tendon, usually 2-6cm from the insertion to the heel bone, may not be clinically obvious and may be confused with tendonitis</li><br /></ol><br />Achilles tendonitis is a chronic condition characterized by pain and often swelling in the Achilles tendon.  Symptoms are often due to swelling and inflammation of the tissue (paratenon) that surrounds the Achilles tendon. As such, the condition may be more appropriately described as an Achilles Tenosynovitis (Inflammation of the lining surrounding the Achilles tendon). The location of the symptoms in non-insertional tendonitis is about 2-6 cm above the insertion of the Achilles tendon on to the heel bone. (Figure 1)  For <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/posterior-heel-pain">Insertional Achilles Tendonitis</a></strong></em>, pain and swelling is located where the Achilles tendon inserts to the heel bone (Figure 1).<br /><h5>Figure 1:  Location of Symptoms:  Achilles tendonitis versus Insertional Achilles Tendonitis</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Achilles-Tendonitis-vs-Insertional-Tendonitis-Location-of-Symptoms-1.png">^media_display_589c2936de9125bcb7692fca/position:center^</a>Achilles tendonitis is often associated with an increase in activity level such as starting a new training regimen or attempting to resume a normal activity level after an injury to another part of the foot or ankle.  The recent increase in shoes with negative heels as a way to “tone” the muscles of the lower extremity has resulted in more Achilles tendonitis as these shoes tend to increase the load through the Achilles tendon. (Figure 2)  Irritation to the synovial sheath that encloses the Achilles tendon is thought to be caused either by direct pressure from shoe wear or from an irregularity in the Achilles tendon. The Achilles tendon is believed to suffer microtearing when it is overloaded, and the body’s healing response to this microtearing may also contribute to symptoms. Despite the pain originating from the Achilles tendon, the tendon itself is usually intact, and the presence of Achilles tendonitis is not believed to increase the risk of an<em><strong> <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/achilles-tendon-rupture">Achilles Tendon rupture</a></strong></em>.<br /><h5>Figure 2: Typical location of Achilles Tendonitis symptoms</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Achilles-Tendonitis-Figure-1.jpg">^media_display_589c2937de9125bcb7692fcd/position:center^</a><br /><h2>Physical Examination</h2><br />Examination will usually reveal swelling and tenderness around the Achilles tendon. The physician may detect swollen, inflamed tissue lining the Achilles.  If there has been any kind of an associated injury, it is important to ensure that the tendon is intact and that the problem is not in fact an <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/achilles-tendon-rupture">Achilles tendon rupture</a></strong></em>.  This is done by performing the “Thompson Test”, whereby the patient lies face down with their feet hanging off the end of the bed.  The calf muscle is then squeezed and the foot should move if the Achilles is intact.<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />X-rays will usually be negative for non-insertional Achilles tendonitis, unless there is calcification of the Achilles tendon, which is relatively rare except in older patients. However, for insertional Achilles tendonitis, a calcaneal spur can be seen in an x ray. An MRI can give a detailed view of the soft tissue but may not be indicated for an initial assessment of Achilles tendonitis, unless the physician is attempting to answer a specific question (i.e. tendon rupture). An ultrasound can also be used as it is more readily available and less expensive than an MRI.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br />Most patients with Achilles tendonitis can be treated effectively with non-operative treatment. This usually involves a period to let the symptoms settle, followed by a gradual return to normal activities. The elements of non-operative treatment may include:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/non-operative-treatment/activity-modification/">Activity Modification</a>. </em>In the short term, it may be necessary to stop any precipitating activities. Precipitating activities include high impact exercises that cause weight to be placed on the front part of the foot.  This includes running, jumping, walking up hills and repetitive stair climbing.  New training programs should be reviewed and stopped, at least until the symptoms resolve.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Shoe Wear Modification. </em>It is important to avoid shoes that precipitate or aggravate symptoms.  In general, using <em><a href="/comfort-shoes">well fitted &quot;comfort&quot; shoes</a></em> will be beneficial. Some shoe modifications may also be helpful.  Some patients will feel more comfortable in shoes with a slight heel, or with the addition of a heel lift inside the shoe. An increased heel height will tend to take some of the load off of the Achilles tendon.  Patients should avoid shoes with a &quot;Negative Heel&quot; (i.e. the heel height is lower than the forefoot height) as this has been shown to increase the force through the Achilles, often leading to the development of Achilles tendonitis. Aggravating shoes should be modified or discarded so that they do not cause an increase or recurrence of symptoms.</li><br /> 	<li> <em>Medications. </em>Anti-inflammatory medications taken 1-3 times per day can help to settle symptoms in the short term, and break the cycle of pain and discomfort. However, for successful long-term management,<a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/non-operative-treatment/non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory-drugs-nsaids/"> NSAIDs</a> usually need to be combined with other non-operative treatment strategies.</li><br /> 	<li><em><a href="/calf-stretch">Calf and Achilles Stretching</a>. </em>A tight calf muscle will increase the force going through the Achilles tendon and predispose the tendon to micro-tearing.  A consistent calf stretching program is an important part of treatment. (Figure 3)</li><br /></ul><br /><h5>Figure 3: Calf Stretching</h5><br /> <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Achilles-Tendinitis-Calf-Stretching.png">^media_display_589c2938de9125bcb7692fd0/position:center^</a> <br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em><a href="/double-leg-heel-rises">Double leg heel rises</a>. </em>A high repetition, low resistance calf strengthening program can be very helpful in stretching and strengthening the Achilles tendon and calf muscle.  Double leg heel rises, done in a controlled manner and performed while standing on the edge of stairs, (to allow for more movement through the ankle) can be very helpful.  Consider starting with 5 sets of 5 repetitions and slowly over a period of weeks advance to 10-15 sets of 15 repetitions.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Eccentric Achilles Tendon Exercises (ex. Heel Drops). </em>Controlled exercises where the Achilles tendon is being lengthened while the calf muscle contracts have been shown to be very helpful in improving the symptoms associated with Achilles tendonitis.  An example of this type of exercise is a &quot;Heel drop&quot;, where the patient stands on their toes while positioned on the edge of a ledge, such as a stair. (Figure 4) They then slowly lower their heels down below the ledge, simultaneously stretching and strengthening the Achilles tendon.  This can be done with both legs at the same time (bilaterally) or for a more concentrated effort, one leg at a time.  It can also be done with the knees straight (putting force on the gastrocnemius) or with the knees bent (putting force on the soleus).  Patients should gradually work up to performing 5 sets of 10 repetitions.  These exercises should be performed 5-6 days per week during the active treatment phase, and then 3 times per week to minimize the chance of developing recurrent symptoms. It is CRITICAL that this exercise be approached cautiously, as it has the potential to put excessive pressure on the Achilles. Patients should always warm up first (ex. get their blood flowing on an exercise bike for 5-10 minutes) before performing these exercises.</li><br /></ul><br /><h5>Figure 4: Heel Drop Exercise</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Achilles-Tendonitis_fig5.png">^media_display_589c2939de9125bcb7692fd3/position:center^</a> <br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em><a href="/prp-plasma-rich-protein-injections">PRP injections</a>. </em>It has been proposed that injecting plasma-rich protein (PRP), taken from the patients’ own blood, may stimulate healing.  However, there is a lack of evidence supporting that notion that PRP injections are more effective than traditional treatment options --or even when compared to placebo treatments.</li><br /></ul><br /><h2>Surgical Treatment</h2><br />Surgery is considered when non-operative measures fail. Patient compliance and postoperative management are important factors in preventing ankle stiffness or recurrence of the symptoms. Surgery usually requires removal of the damaged tissue (debridement) and meticulous repair of the tendon. Postoperative immobilization is required, followed by the gradual introduction of range of motion and strengthening exercises. It may require 6 months to achieve full recovery. Some known complications are recurrence, stiffness of the ankle, and deep vein thrombosis.<br /><p>  Edited on January 24, 2017 (Originally edited by <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/peter-stavrou-md-editor"><strong><em>Dr. Peter Stavrou, MD</em></strong></a>)<span style="font-size: 10px;"> </span></p>
Edited by <strong><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/marcus-coe-md/">Marcus Coe, MD, MS</a></em></strong><br /><h2>Summary</h2><br />Chronic posterior tibial tendon insufficiency can result in acquired adult flatfoot deformity, also referred to as pes planus, a fallen arch or simply flatfoot deformity.  This is a chronic foot condition where the soft-tissues (including the posterior tibial tendon, deltoid and spring ligaments) on the inside aspect of the foot and ankle are subject to repetitive load during walking and standing. Over time, these structures may become painful, swollen, or incompetent. When these supporting structures fail, the result is a change in the alignment of the foot. This condition is typically associated with a progressive flatfoot deformity, leading to increased strain on the supporting structures on the inside of the ankle, and loading through the outer aspect of the ankle and foot.  Both the inside and outside of the ankle can become painful, resulting in significant disability. This condition can often be treated without surgery by strengthening the involved muscles and tendons, or withbracing. When non-operative treatment fails, surgery can improve alignment and pain through soft tissue transfers, realignment of bones or fusions.   Alignment and function can be restored, however, the time to maximal improvement is typically six months to a year.It is also important to realize that not all flatfoot deformities result from problems with the posterior tibial tendon.  A flat foot can be a normal variant and does not necessarily need treatment if it is non painful and does not limit function.<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />Patients with acquired adult flatfoot deformity typically provide a history of longstanding pain at the inside of the foot and ankle, resulting in progressive, painful  <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/characteristics-of-flat-foot">flatfeet</a></strong></em> (figure 1). Symptoms of pain may have developed gradually as a result of overuse, or they may be traced to one injury. Typically, the pain localizes to the inside (medial) aspect of the ankle, under the medial malleolus (see circle in fig. 1 ). However, some patients will also experience pain over the outside (lateral) aspect of the hind-foot, because of the resultant deformity and pressure or impingement on the lateral structures of the foot and ankle. This usually occurs later in the course of the condition. Patients may walk with a limp or, in advanced cases, be disabled due to pain. Figure 1: Flatfoot deformity<br /><h5>Figure 1: Flatfoot deformity</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/FlatFoot-Figure-1.jpg">^media_display_589c293ade9125bcb7692fd7/position:center^</a><br /><h2>Physical Examination</h2><br />Looking at the patient when they stand will usually demonstrate a flatfoot deformity (marked flattening of the medial longitudinal arch ). The front part of the foot (forefoot) is often splayed out to the side, leading to the presence of a “too many toes”sign (Figure 2).  This sign is present when the toes can be seen from directly behind the patient.<br /><h5>Figure 2: “Too many toes sign”</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/FlatFoot-Figure-2.jpg">^media_display_589c293bde9125bcb7692fda/position:center^</a>The dysfunction may affect the patient’s walkin, as the patient's dysfunctional posterior tibial tendon can no longer stabilize the arch of the foot when weight is placed on it. There is often tenderness to  touch and swelling over the inside of the ankle just below the bony prominence (the medial malleolus). There may also be pain in the outside aspect of the ankle with palpation. This pain originates from impingement or compression of two tendons between the outside ankle bone (fibula) and the heel bone, (calcaneus) when the patient is standing.A single-leg heel rise test is used to determine whether the posterior tibial tendon is intact or whether it has become dysfunctional. If the patient can stand on one foot and raise the heel off of the ground 3-5 times, then this suggests that the posterior tibial tendon is intact (figure 3 [left]). If they are unable to do this, the posterior tibial tendon is likely dysfunctional (Figure 3 [right]).<br /><h5>Figure 3: Ability to do a single leg heel rise (left picture); Inability to do a single leg heel rise (right picture)</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/FlatFoot-Figure-3A.jpg">^media_display_589c293cde9125bcb7692fdd/position:center^</a><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/acquired-adult-flatfoot-deformity-posterior-tibial-tendon-dysfunction/foot-deformity-fig-3-b-2/">^media_display_589c2942de9125bcb7692fe1/position:center^</a><br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />X-Rays of the foot taken while weight bearing allows the physician to assess the extent of the flatfoot deformity (Figures 4a &amp; 4b).<br /><h5>Figure 4a: Normal Foot X-Ray</h5><br /><h5><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/FlatFoot-Figure4A.jpg">^media_display_589c2942de9125bcb7692fe4/position:center^</a></h5><br /><h5>Figure 4b: X-Ray of Flatfoot Deformity</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/FlatFoot-Figure4b.jpg">^media_display_589c2943de9125bcb7692fe7/position:center^</a>MRI is usually not indicated for patients with acquired adult flatfoot deformity, as the diagnosis and the classification can be established on physical examination. However, if there are other clinical signs that suggest either a problem within the ankle, the subtalar joint, (intra-articular pathology) or another source of pain, then an MRI may be indicated.<br /><h2>Classification</h2><br />Acquired adult flatfoot deformity has been classified into four categories.<strong><em>First Stage</em></strong>The first stage represents inflammation and symptoms originating from an irritated posterior tibial tendon, which is still functional.<strong><em>Second Stage</em></strong>Stage two is characterized by a change in the alignment of the foot, noted on observation while standing (see above photos). The deformity is supple, meaning the foot is freely movable and a “normal” position can be restored by the examiner.  Stage two is also associated with the inability to perform a single-leg heel rise.<strong><em>Third Stage</em></strong>The third stage represents a flatfoot deformity that becomes stiff because of arthritis.  Prolonged deformity causes irritation to the involved joints, resulting in arthritis and the inability to correct the foot to a normal position.<strong><em>Fourth Stage</em></strong>The fourth phase is a flatfoot deformitywhere deformity, stiffness and/or arthritis extends to involvement of the ankle joint. This occurs when the deltoid ligament, the major supporting structure on the inside of the ankle, fails to provide support. The ankle becomes unstable and will demonstrate a tilted appearance on X-ray.  Failure of the deltoid ligament results from an inward displacement of the weight bearing forces.  When prolonged, this change can lead to ankle arthritis.The vast majority of patients with acquired adult flatfoot deformity have reached stage 2 by the time they seek treatment from a physician.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br /><h3>Non-Operative Treatment</h3><br /><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/non-operative-protocol-for-flatfoot-deformity">Nonoperative treatment of stage 1 and 2 acquired adult flatfoot deformity can be successful</a></strong></em>.General components of the treatment include:▪     The use of <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/comfort-shoes">comfort shoes</a></strong></em>.▪     <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/activity-modification">Activity modification</a></strong></em> to avoid exacerbating activities and strengthening to build support.▪     <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/weight-loss">Weight loss</a></strong></em> if indicated.Specific components of treatment that over time can lead to marked improvement in symptoms include:▪     <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/non-operative-protocol-for-flatfoot-deformity">A high repetition, low resistance strengthening program</a></strong></em>▪     Appropriate <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-lacers">bracing</a></strong></em> or a <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/pre-fabricated-over-the-counter-orthotics-insert">medial longitudinal arch support</a></strong></em>.If the posterior tibial tendon is intact, a series of exercises aimed at strengthening the elongated and dysfunctional tendon can be successful.

Edited by <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/marcus-coe-md/">Marcus Coe, MD, MS </a><br /><h2>Summary</h2><br />Ankle arthritis leads to pain and swelling in the ankle joint. Symptoms are often aggravated by standing and walking, and patients often walk with a limp. Ankle arthritis commonly results from a history of trauma to the ankle; either a severe ankle injury, such as a bad ankle fracture, or a series of recurrent injuries to the ankle. However, ankle arthritis may develop from other causes, such as uneven loading of the ankle joint due to an alignment deformity; inflammatory arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis; crystal arthritis, such as gout, or secondary to a serious joint infection. Patients with severe ankle arthritis will often have limited ankle motion and may have a grinding sound when they move their ankle joint. Ankle arthritis is commonly associated with loss of cartilage from the ankle joint, which will show up on a weight-bearing ankle x-ray (Figure 1). Non-operative treatment is designed to improve function and decrease pain, and is based on: limiting the amount of loading through the ankle joint (weight loss, activity modification, cane); controlling the symptoms (anti-inflammatory medication, pain medications); and decreasing ankle joint movement (ankle bracing, rocker-bottom shoewear). Operative treatment may be helpful if non-operative treatment is unsuccessful. Common operative treatments include cleaning out (debriding) the ankle joint if the ankle arthritis is not severe, or ankle fusion for patients with severe arthritis. Ankle replacement may be an option for older patients who are not excessively active or for patients with other major foot fusions.Figure 1: Normal Ankle Joint (Above).  Severe Ankle Arthritis (Below).<br /><h3><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Ankle-Arthritis-Figure-1.png">^media_display_589c2944de9125bcb7692feb/position:center^</a></h3><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Ankle-Arthritis-Figure-2.jpg">^media_display_589c2945de9125bcb7692fee/position:center^</a><br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />Ankle pain, stiffness and swelling are characteristic symptoms of ankle arthritis. Pain is often aggravated by activities, such as standing and walking. &quot;Start-up&quot; pain, such as when a patient has pain and stiffness in the ankle after sleeping or sitting in one spot for a while, is also a common complaint. When this occurs, it often takes the patient a few minutes (or longer) to &quot;warm-up&quot; the ankle. The ankle will tend to swell more as the day progresses, particularly if there is increasing activity. Pain is often experienced throughout the ankle, although it may be more noticeable at the front of the ankle if large bones spurs have formed. Ankle arthritis occurs when there has been damage to the joint cartilage that normally covers the ends of the bones of the ankle joint. Loss of cartilage leading to ankle arthritis can occur from a variety of causes including:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em>Major ankle trauma</em> (such as an ankle fracture). This is the most common cause of significant ankle arthritis and, therefore, a history of an ankle or lower extremity fracture often increase the risk of developing ankle arthritis.</li><br /> 	<li>Many small to moderate <em>recurrent injuries to the ankle joint over time</em> (such as ankle instability and recurrent ankle sprains)</li><br /> 	<li><em>Abnormal ankle joint loading</em> leading to a wearing of the cartilage in one area of the ankle (such as occurs in people with long standing marked flatfoot deformities or other conditions causing abnormal alignment of the ankle or lower extremity)</li><br /> 	<li><em>Inflammatory arthritis</em> such as rheumatoid arthritis. In this situation, an inflamed joint lining can eventually damage the joint cartilage.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Crystal arthritis</em> such as gout or psuedo-gout which leads to inflammation in the joint and may eventually lead to destruction to the joint cartilage.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Infectious arthritis</em> can cause ankle joint damage if bacteria in the joint lead to destruction of the joint cartilage.</li><br /></ul><br /><h2>Physical Examination</h2><br />On physical examination, the patient will often have ankle swelling relative to the opposite ankle. There is likely to be a restriction in ankle motion, which may be associated with cracking or popping. Patients may walk with a noticeable limp.<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />Ankle arthritis can be diagnosed on plain ankle x-rays (Figure 1). X-rays performed with the patient weight bearing will demonstrate:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em>Loss of joint space</em>. This correlates with the loss of joint cartilage.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Bone spurs</em>. Bone spurs are known as &quot;osteophytes&quot; and they often occur as the body's natural response to arthritis.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Increased bone density at the joint line</em>. As a result of  increasing loading forces due to the loss of cartilage, the bone often thickens at the level of the joint line, leading to &quot;subchondral sclerosis.&quot; This appears as increased whiteness in the bone on x-rays.</li><br /></ul><br />In subtle cases, or if there are other questions that need to be answered, it may be necessary for the treating doctor to order an MRI or a CT Scan of the ankle and hindfoot.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br />There are non-operative and operative treatments for ankle arthritis. The goals of treatment are to minimize pain and discomfort, and to improve function. The type of treatment that is most appropriate will depend on the patient's symptoms, the extent of the ankle arthritis, other treatments tried, and the patient's preferences. Often, non-operative treatment can be successful in significantly decreasing symptoms. Many of the non-operative treatment approaches can also be helpful in conjunction with surgery.<br /><h3>Non-Operative Treatment</h3><br /><em><a href="https://youtu.be/L4uT2tBuEDI">Watch Video: Ankle Arthritis- Non-Operative Treatment</a></em>There are a variety of non-operative treatments.

Surgical options include:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em><strong>Ankle debridement</strong> </em>(Cleaning out of the ankle joint by removing bone spurs). In patients with mild to moderate arthritis, especially those with pain at the front of their ankle and limitation in their ability to bring their foot towards their shin (Limited dorsiflexion), ankle debridement can be very helpful. This can be done arthroscopically, although if the bone spurs are large, it is sometimes easier to do it by opening up ankle joint.</li><br /> 	<li><strong><em><a href="/ankle-fusion-arthrodesis">Ankle Fusion</a></em></strong> (Ankle Arthrodesis). For patients with painful end-stage arthritis, (no or very little cartilage remaining), an ankle fusion can often improve a patients symptoms significantly. The painful ankle joint articulation is removed by fusing the two main bones of the ankle joint (the tibia and talus) together so they form one bone. While an ankle fusion stops movement through the ankle joint, movement through the remaining joints in the foot provides a significant amount of the movement needed for walking normally.</li><br /> 	<li><strong><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/surgical-procedures/ankle-replacement-ankle-arthroplasty/">Ankle Replacement</a> </em></strong>(Ankle Arthroplasty). Ankle replacements can produce significant pain relief, however, as the biomechanics of the ankle joint will predispose to failure of the prosthesis over time, ankle replacements are often reserved for older patients who are relatively less active. They may be appropriate for patients that have other fusions in their hindfoot as well.</li><br /> 	<li><em><strong>Realignment of Deformities</strong>.</em> Occasionally, ankle arthritis will be caused by a deformity below the ankle joint (ex. severe flatfoot) or above the ankle joint (ex. old tibia fracture that has healed crookedly), which leads to a concentration of force in a localized area of the ankle joint (and subsequent wearing out of cartilage in this area). In some situations (ex. relatively young patients), these patients may be candidates for surgery (ex. a <em><strong><a href="/calcaneal-osteotomy">calcaneal osteotomy</a></strong></em>), which corrects their deformity and thereby redistributes the load to an area of the ankle joint where the cartilage is still preserved.</li><br /></ul><br /><em><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications"><strong>Potential Surgical Complications</strong>:</a></em> Any surgical procedure may lead to a surgical complication. Procedures to address ankle arthritis are no exception!<br /><h3>Less Common, Experimental, or Unproven Procedures for Ankle Arthritis</h3><br /><ul><br /><ul><br /> 	<li><strong><em>Distraction Arthroplasty (Arthrodiastasis)</em></strong>. It has been suggested that distracting the ankle joint for a few months by placing a ringed external fixator (a device with pins going through the bones above and below the ankle joint) may help patients with significant ankle arthritis. It is unclear exactly how this may help patients, although there have been some reports of success with this treatment. Unfortunately, widespread success with this procedure has not yet been documented.</li><br /> 	<li><strong><em>Total Ankle Allograft</em></strong>. In a few centers, surgeons have replaced the entire arthritic ankle joint with a &quot;healthy&quot; ankle joint taken from a recently deceased human donor in a procedure akin to an organ transplant. There was great excitment in the foot and ankle community when this procedure was described a few years ago. Unfortunately, it does not appear as if the intermendiate and long-term results of this type of procedure have produced the desired results.</li><br /> 	<li><strong><em>Interposition Arthroplasty</em></strong>. Placing a soft-tissue graft inside the ankle joint (also known as &quot;Total Ankle Replacement with No Metal&quot;) is designed to pad the joint, while still maintaining some ankle movement. This is known as an interpostional (in between) arthroplasty (joint replacement). In the past, this type of procedure has been performed in many joints of the body (hips, knees, wrists, etc.) and it has not met with any long-term success. There is no reason to expect the results in the ankle joint will be any different.</li><br /></ul><br /></ul><br /><p>Edited November 14, 2016,</p>

Figure 4). When the foot is rotated outward, the bone (fibula) on the outside of the ankle (lateral aspect) is broken first. If the rotation continues, the structures on the inside of the ankle (medial aspect) are disrupted - either the bone (medial malleolus) is broken or the supporting ligament (deltoid ligament) is torn. If the foot rotates inward, the medial malleolus of the tibia can be broken first, followed by the fibula if rotation continues. The rotation injury may also cause tearing of the syndesmosis (the strong fibrous tissue that holds the two bones of the lower leg together at the ankle), which can lead to a fibula fracture higher up the leg.<br /><h5>Figure 4:  Twisting mechanism causing an Ankle Fracture</h5><br />^media_display_589c2949de9125bcb7692ffb/position:center^ A <em><strong><a href="/stable-ankle-fracture">stable ankle fracture</a></strong></em> (Figure 2) occurs if just the outside bone (fibula) is broken and the syndesomosis structures on the inside of the ankle (medial malleolus and deltoid ligaments) are intact. Stable ankle fractures can be treated non-operatively by limiting activity until the bone has healed (usually 6 weeks).An <em><strong><a href="/unstable-ankle-fracture">unstable ankle fracture</a></strong></em> (Figure 3) occurs if the injury causes the structures on the inside (medial aspect) of the ankle to be disrupted. This type of injury allows the lower bone of the ankle (the talus) to be loose and potentially poorly positioned within the ankle joint (See Figure 3). These disrupted inside (medial) strutures include either the medial malleolus (the prominent bump on the inside of the ankle), or the deltoid ligament (the strong ligament that supports the inside of the ankle joint). Most unstable ankle fractures benefit from surgery to stabilize the fractures and ensure that the joint heals in an anatomic position (Figure 5). In addition to the potential risks associated with surgery, patients are at increased risk of developing <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-arthritis">ankle arthritis </a></strong></em>following an ankle fracture. Even ideal treatment of an ankle fracture may still lead to ankle arthritis if there is significant joint (cartilage damage) that occurs at the time of the injury.<br /><h5>Figure 5: Unstable Ankle Fracture stabilized with surgery</h5><br />^media_display_589c294ade9125bcb7692ffe/position:center^<br /><p> Edited on December 4th, 2016</p><br /><p>Previously edited by <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/john-early-md/">John Early, MD</a></p>
<h2>Summary</h2><br /><p class="summary">Stable ankle fractures involve a fracture of the outside bone of the ankle joint (the fibula). However, although the outside bone is fractured, the ankle joint itself remains well positioned and stable. They are associated with pain, resulting in it being very difficult or even impossible to walk on the ankle. Treatment is non-operative, although it often takes 6 weeks or more for the bone to heal. The total time to a complete recovery can be many months.</p><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />Patients will usually report a twisting injury to the ankle. The foot may be rolled to the inside similar to an ankle sprain, or the foot may be fixed on the ground while the body rotates around it. In either case, patients will describe pain and swelling in their ankle. Often they will not be able to bear weight on the ankle, although in some cases they may be able to walk with significant pain.<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />Plain x-rays of the ankle joint will identify a fracture (Figure 1) of the outer bone of the ankle (the fibula). However, the ankle joint itself will be intact and will be exactly where it should be. In some instances, the ankle joint will appear to be intact, but the joint will displace when it is stressed, demonstrating that the ankle fracture is actually unstable.<br /><h5>Figure 1: Plain X-rays of a Stable Ankle Fracture</h5><br />^media_display_589c294bde9125bcb7693002/position:center^<strong><span style="color: #444444; line-height: 24px;">There are two common types of stable ankle fractures:</span></strong><br /><ol><br />	<li><em>Pulling Fractures of the Fibula (Avulsion or Weber A type fractures)</em>. These injuries are equivalent to a severe ankle sprain. The main difference is that instead of the outside ankle ligament tearing, the ligament pulls a piece of the fibula off (Figure).</li><br />	<li><em>Twisting Fractures of the Fibula (Weber B1-type fractures)</em>. In these fractures, the foot (and therefore the lower bone of the ankle) is fixed on the ground while the body (and therefore the two upper bones of the ankle) rotates inwards, causing the outer ankle bone (the fibula) to break (Figure 2). However, the rotation stops before the structures on the inside of the ankle are injured. Therefore the ankle joint itself remains anatomically positioned and stable.</li><br /></ol><br /><h5>Figure 2: Twisting Mechanism of Injury</h5><br />^media_display_589c294cde9125bcb7693005/position:center^<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br />Stable ankle fractures may be treated without surgery because the ankle joint itself remains truly stable. If the joint is displaced or if there is some question about the integrity of the ankle joint, then surgery is often indicated.<br /><h3>Non-Operative Treatment</h3><br /><ul><br />	<li><em>Relative immobilization. </em>Non-weight bearing or limited weight-bearing will limit pain, and allow the fracture to heal without being subject to excessive motion. Commonly, a walking boot such as a CAM walker is used.</li><br />	<li><em>Ice</em>. Ice is used to decrease the blood flow to the ankle and therefore decrease the swelling. A certain amount of blood flowing to the ankle is important, however, in patients who have recently suffered an ankle fracture, there is often too much blood flowing to the area.</li><br />	<li><em>Elevation</em>. Elevation will help limit the swelling and thereby decrease the pain. In general the ankle should be elevated 6-12&quot; inches above the heart (i.e. with the foot on a pillow when you are lying down)</li><br />	<li><em>Early Range of Motion</em>. The ankle joint itself is stable so early motion can help prevent stiffness and allow muscle strength to be retained.</li><br />	<li><em>Time</em>. Bones that are broken (fractured) just take time to heal. Usually it takes a minimum of 6 weeks before a bone such as the fibula heals enough to withstand normal everyday forces (ex. normal walking) through the ankle joint. However, it often takes many months for the fracture, soft-tissues, and muscle strength to return to pre-injury levels.</li><br />	<li><em>Rehabilitation</em>. Aggressive rehabilitation working on regaining lost strength, motion, and proprioception, is often instituted after the bones have healed enough to withstand these forces (often 6 weeks). This type of rehabilitation program is often overseen by a physical therapist.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>Edited September 24, 2015</p>
<h2>Summary</h2><br /><p class="summary">In unstable ankle fractures, the ankle joint itself is displaced or can be displaced when it is subject to normal forces. Specifically, the lower bone of the ankle joint (the talus) is out of position or can be shifted out of position, leading incogruity of the ankle joint. For ankle fracture to be unstable the restraining structures on the inside (medical side) of the ankle (Deltoid ligament and or medical malleolus) are disrupted.  <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/surgical-procedures/ankle-fracture-surgery/">Unstable ankle fractures often require surgery</a> to reposition bones and stabilize the ankle joint.</p><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />Patients with unstable ankle fractures are invariably in a lot of pain and require urgent medical attention. They will often report a twisting injury to their ankle with their foot fixed on the ground (ex. stuck in a hole in the ground). They will not be able to weight-bear. The examinimg physician will assess the extent of deformity, look for any associated wounds that would suggests that the fracture has broken through the skin, and assess muscle and nerve function.<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />Plain x-rays of the ankle will be taken. However, for grossly displaced fractures it is often beneficial for the ankle joint to be repositioned (reduced) before the x-rays are taken. X-rays determine whether an ankle fracture is present and help determine if the injury is stable or unstable.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br />Initial managment of the fracture begins at the scene of the injury. The lower leg should be splinted and if available a bag of ice my be applied to the area. Further management occurs when the patient reaches the emergency room. If the ankle is markedly displaced (ex. dislocated) it will be necessary for a physician to perform a preliminary repositioning (reduction) of the ankle joint in the emergency room. This is done by sedating the patient or injecting local anesthitic in the ankle joint and then providing gentle traction on the ankle joint. If one of the fractures has broken through the skin this is considered an &quot;open fracture&quot; and relatively urgent surgery is warranted to clean out the fracture site in an effort to minimize the chance of a serious deep infection. However, if the ankle is markedly swollen and the skin is intact it may be desirable to wait a few days (or more) to let the swelling around the ankle settle as operating through swollen tissue is associated with a higher infection rate. If this is the case then the ankle is splinted and the patient is given pain medication. Elevating the involved leg above the level of the heart and placing a bag of ice (or a bag of frozen vegetables) over the area for 10-15 minutes at a time may be helpful.Adequate treatment of an unstable ankle fracture not only requires healing of the fracture and any injured ligaments, but also a realignment of the ankle joint. Both healing and realignment must occur to ensure that the joint is congruent and thereby minimizes the risks of long-term ankle arthritis. For this reason, it is common for unstable ankle fractures to <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/surgical-procedures/ankle-fracture-surgery/">require surgery ( ankle open reduction internal fixation)</a>. Surgery is oriented towards repositioning (reducing) the fracture and fixing it in the previous anatomic position. In addition, it is important that the surgeon ensure that the ankle joint (mortise) is anatomically positioned following the surgery. In order to do this, it is necessary to take x-ray (fluoroscopic) images during the surgery. In order to stabilize a disrupted ankle mortise, it may be necessary for the surgeon to place one or more screws across the two bones of the lower leg (Tibia and Fibula) to stabilize the relationship between these two bones while the ligaments connecting these bones (syndesmosis) heals. After these syndesmotic ligaments have healed (3-6 months) it may be necessary to remove these screws.In some patients with significant medical conditions or where an anatomical reduction has been obtained without surgery, it may be possible to treat an unstable ankle fracture non-operatively. However, this situation is the exception rather than the rule.<br /><h2>Recovery</h2><br />Patients undergoing surgical stabilization of an unstable ankle fracture usually require a minimum of 6 weeks non-weight-bearing in a cast after the surgery. During this &quot;healing phase&quot;, the bones and ligaments need to heal adequately. In some highly compliant patients with relatively stable fractures, it may be possible to treat them in a removable cast boot to allow some gentle early range of motion. Following the 6-week period of healing, more aggressive rehabilitation is performed as the patient enters the &quot;rehabilitation phase&quot; of recovery. The rehab phase is oriented towards regaining ankle motion, strength, and proprioception. Patients often need to walk in a protective boot or brace for a number of weeks or even months after they are allowed to begin weight-bearing. It is common for it to take six months (or more) for patients to feel comfortable performing basic everyday activities (walking a number of blocks, standing for prolonged periods, basic sporting activities, etc.) It can be a total of 12-18 months before patients who have suffered an unstable ankle fracture reach their &quot;point of maximal improvement.&quot;<br /><h2>Complications</h2><br />The main potential complication that is specific to an ankle fracture is the potential for long-term ankle arthritis. A previous ankle fracture is the most common reason why patients develop significant ankle arthritis. However, most ankle fractures will not produce significant long-term arthritis. The key determinants of whether long-term arthritis will develop is whether there has been extensive cartilage damage at the time of the original injury, and whether an anatomical reduction of the ankle joint has been obtained.Patients undergoing surgery have the usual potential risks of surgery including:<br /><ul><br />	<li><em>Infection</em></li><br />	<li><em>Wound healing problems</em></li><br />	<li><em>Nerve injury</em></li><br />	<li><em>Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)</em></li><br />	<li><em>Pulmonary Embolism</em></li><br />	<li><em>Non-Union</em></li><br />	<li><em>Mal-Union</em></li><br /></ul><br /><p>Edited September 24, 2015</p>

Symptoms are often aggravated by forcing the foot upwards (dorsiflexion). Often the impingement occurs as a result of a bone spur (osteophyte) at the front of the ankle joint although impingement can also occur secondary to soft tissue. Ankle impingement is commonly associated with <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/ankle-arthritis/">ankle arthritis</a> but it can also occur in soccer players, dancers, and other individuals who repetitively load the ankle joint. <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/biomechanics-of-foot-and-ankle/equinus-contractures/">A tight calf muscle</a> may contribute to the development of anterior ankle impingement. Treatment can be non-operative (wearing shoes with a slight heel, limiting activities, taking anti-inflammatory medication, taping the ankle, etc.) or operative (removing the bone spur and/or soft tissue). As the bone spur has usually formed in response to some other stimulus (exp. ankle arthritis or tight calf muscle) it is not uncommon for the bone spur to recur after it has been removed surgically.<br /><h2>Background and Clinical Presentation</h2><br />Anterior ankle impingement is the most common cause of pain in the front of the ankle joint (Figure 1). In this case “impingement” describes an increase in pressure or impact at the front (anterior) of the ankle joint while walking.  The associated pain is typically proportional to weight bearing activity.  However, it is usually worse with the first few steps after getting out of bed in the morning or after sitting for a while (referred to as “start-up” pain).  This increase in pressure (impingement) may be caused by calf tightness where one (gastrocnemius) or both (gastrocnemius and soleus) of the calf muscles are tight.  Together, the end of the shin bone (tibial plafond) and the lower bone of the ankle joint (talus) form the primary weight-bearing surface of the ankle joint.  While walking, as the body progresses over the foot, the increased tension on the Achilles tendon prevents the roof of the ankle (tibial plafond) from gliding over the talus.  Instead, the front of the tibial plafond impacts or impinges on the joint surface of the talus.  This impingement not only causes pain but, may begin to cause the breakdown of joint cartilage between the two surfaces (arthritis).  Left unchecked, the irritation to the joint often results in the formation of bone spurs. Bone spurs form in response to increase joint pressure and irritation.  Spurring of the tibial plafond typically appears as a “beak” or “awning” extending from the end of the upper bone of the ankle joint (tibia).  On the talus side, the spur usually looks like a bump in front of the ankle.  These spurs are seen on lateral x-rays of the ankle and serve to physically block upward ankle motion (Figure 2).The causes of anterior ankle impingement are related to any condition that leads to bone spurs in the front of the ankle.  Potential causes include: <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/ankle-arthritis/">ankle arthritis</a> or a <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/biomechanics-of-foot-and-ankle/equinus-contractures/">tight calf muscle</a> leading to bone spur development.<br /><h5>Figure 1:  Location of Pain in Anterior Ankle Impingement</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Figure-1-Ankle-Impingement-Pain-Location.jpg">^media_display_589c294cde9125bcb769300a/position:center^</a><br /><h5>Figure 2:  Impingement “Jamming” in the Front (Anterior) Ankle</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Figure-2-Ankle-Impingment.jpg">^media_display_589c294dde9125bcb769300d/position:center^</a><br /><h2> Imaging Studies</h2><br />Anterior ankle impingement may result in narrowing of the joint space by damaging joint cartilage.  Later, the bone spurs at the front of the ankle can be seen on an ankle x-ray taken from the side (lateral view). The size of the bone spur can vary from very small to quite large (Figure 3). X-rays may also demonstrate mild, moderate, or even severe ankle arthritis.In early impingement, MRI may demonstrate inflammation or fluid accumulation in the bone of the ankle joint.  However, in the absence of findings on plain x-rays, the diagnosis is fairly straightforward and based on physical examination.<br /><h5>Figure 3:  Anterior Ankle Bone Spurs</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Figure-3-Ankle-Bone-Spurs.jpg">^media_display_589c294ede9125bcb7693010/position:center^</a><br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br /><h3>Non-Operative Treatment</h3><br />Early on, treatment should focus on stretching of the calf muscles in an effort to reduce the tension on the Achilles tendon and improving ankle motion.  In some patients physical therapy may be helpful to overcome changes in walking habits that may have developed and contribute to this condition.  Depending on the severity and the patient’s physical demands, symptoms may be improved considerably by modifying activity. Some potentially effective non-operative treatments are:<br /><ol><br /> 	<li><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/foot-and-ankle-physical-therapy/calf-stretch/">Calf stretching</a></em>:  regular stretching of the calf can be very beneficial. This is done in an effort to decrease the tension on the Achilles and to increase ankle motion</li><br /> 	<li><em>Use of a Slightly Elevated Heel</em>: Using a shoe with 1-1.5” heel (or adding a heel lift inside the shoe) means that the foot does not need to come up as far in the course of normal walking.. Therefore, less impingement occurs and patients will tend to be less symptomatic.</li><br /> 	<li> <em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/non-operative-treatment/activity-modification/">Activity Modification</a></em>: If appropriate, avoiding or limiting activities (i.e. certain sporting activities or walking uphill) that cause ankle jamming will tend to cause the symptoms to improve.</li><br /> 	<li><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/non-operative-treatment/non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory-drugs-nsaids/">Anti-inflammatory medication (NSAIDs)</a></em>: The use of anti-inflammatory medication (assuming no contra-indications) can be helpful if persistent symptoms are present.</li><br /> 	<li>An occasional injection of corticosteroid into the ankle joint may be helpful, particularly if there is some underlying ankle arthritis present.</li><br /></ol><br /><ul><br /> 	<li><strong><em>Note well: </em> </strong>While improving symptoms, these efforts will not address the cause of anterior ankle impingement.</li><br /></ul><br /><h3>Operative Treatment</h3><br />The focus of operative treatment is to remove the impinging bone spurs at the front of the ankle and increase ankle motion thereby decreasing the pressure created in the front of the joint during walking.  Treatment of the cause of the problem consists of increasing ankle motion.  This may be accomplished <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/surgical-procedures/gastrocnemius-slide-strayer-procedure/">by lengthening the gastrocnemius tendon</a> in cases where these is a large difference in ankle dorsiflexion (upward motion of the foot relative to the leg).<br /><p align="right">Edited on December 4, 2016 (originally edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/benedict-f-digiovanni-md-editor" target="_blank">Ben DiGiovanni, MD</a>)</strong></em></p><br /> <br /><div></div>
Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/hussein-pazkad-md/">Hossein Pakzad, MD</a></strong></em><br /><h2>Summary</h2><br />Ankle instability is caused by injury to the lateral [outside] ankle ligaments. This usually causes strain or stretch, and in more severe forms, causes sprain or tear in the ligaments. This can lead to a sense of instability (giving out) in the ankle and predispose the patient to get frequent ankle sprains even with minor trauma or twist. Often, patients with ankle instability can be treated without surgery by strengthening the muscles that control the ankle joint, avoiding high-risk activities and using a supportive brace or shoe to decrease the risk of recurrent ankle sprains. In some patients, non-operative treatment is not successful and surgery is required to either tighten up the ligaments supporting the outside of the ankle, or to reconstruct these ligaments using a tendon graft.<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />Patients with ankle instability relate either a history of multiple ankle sprains or a sense of instability - often both of these. They report a sense of their ankle rolling inwards more easily. They may also give a history of multiple prior <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/sprained-ankle">ankle sprains</a></strong></em>. Things that make people at higher risk for suffering an ankle sprain include:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li>A history of previous significant ankle sprains</li><br /> 	<li>Hindfoot varus alignment where the heel position slopes inward towards the midline</li><br /> 	<li>Generalized ligamentous laxity (loose ligaments)</li><br /> 	<li>Participation in high-risk activities (ex. basketball and volleyball. etc.)</li><br /></ul><br />The defining symptom of ankle instability is the instability itself.  However, pain is commonly present. Any complaints of associated chronic pain demand the treating physician identify its source.   Pain can originate from sources inside the ankle joint [intra-articular] or outside of the ankle joint [extra-articular]. Common sources of pain originating from inside the ankle joint include<em><strong> <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/osteochondral-lesions-of-talus-olt-talar-ocds-talar-ocls/">talar osteochondral injuries / lesions</a></strong></em>, impinging bone spurs, and <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-arthritis">ankle arthritis</a></strong></em>. Common sources of pain originating outside of the ankle joint include <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/peroneal-tendonitis">peroneal tendonitis</a></strong></em>, and irritation to the restraining lateral ligaments of the ankle joint.Pure ankle instability (i.e. a floppy loose ankle) needs to be differentiated from &quot;functional ankle instability.&quot;  Functional ankle instability is defined as the sensation that an individual ankle is unstable when in fact the ankle joint itself is still stable. Commonly with functional ankle instability, patients place their ankle in a certain position or load it in a certain way they will experience a pain (often sharp) that gives them a sensation that their ankle is loose. This can be caused by a problem inside the ankle joint such as a <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/osteochondral-lesions-of-talus-olt-talar-ocd-talar-ocl">talar osteochondral lesion</a></strong></em>, ankle impingement, or <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-arthritis">ankle arthritis</a></strong></em>. It is important to identify whether a patient has true ankle instability (a loose floppy ankle) or functional ankle instability because the treatment is often different. Treatment of true ankle instability is focused on reconstructing the ligaments on the lateral side of the ankle, whereas treatment of functional ankle instability is focused more on identifying and eradicating (or controlling) the source of pain.<br /><h2>Relevant Ankle Anatomy</h2><br /><p align="left">Patients with true ankle instability have stretching out or even complete incompetence of some or all of the <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ligaments-of-foot-and-ankle-overview">ligaments on the outside of the ankle joint</a></strong></em>. The two main ligaments in questions are the anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL) and the calcaneofibular ligament (CFL). Incompetence of these ligaments can lead to looseness (increased opening) of the ankle joint and/or the subtalar joint.</p><h2 align="left">Physical Examination</h2><br />Physical examination starts with gait and hindfoot assessment. It is not uncommon for patients to have the back part of the foot curving inwards (hindfoot varus), whereby the alignment of the heel slopes towards the midline of the body. The patient is likely to demonstrate increased inversion laxity. There may also be a positive anterior drawer test. A lateral stress test of the ankle may also be positive. These tests are done in comparison to the opposite ankle. If the patient does complain of chronic pain, this should be localized by palpation. This can help narrow the diagnosis based on the anatomical structures in this area.<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />X-rays are the starting point for evaluation of ankle instability. Weight-bearing ankle x-rays should be performed to assess the ankle joint itself. The ankle joint mortise should be symmetrical.Stress x-rays are also often taken in patients with suspected ankle instability. By stressing the heel towards the midline while x-ray or fluoroscopic image is taken, a sense is gained of how much the outside part of the ankle joint opens up. This should be compared to the opposite ankle. This will also help differentiate whether instability is originating from the ankle joint or the subtalar joint, or both.In patients with chronic pain, an MRI may be indicated. MRI is a sensitive test that usually identifies intra-articular abnormality, such as a talar osteochondral injury, or extra-articular sources of pain, such as tendonitis or scarring of the restraining ligaments. <em>It should be noted that scarring of the anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL) is a common, almost universal finding of most MRIs of the hindfoot, regardless of whether patients have ankle instability or not.</em><br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br />A history of multiple ankle sprains is one of the most common presentations of ankle instability. If the patient has recently had an <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/sprained-ankle">ankle sprain</a></strong></em>, it should be treated as any normal ankle sprain would be.<br /><h3><strong>Non-Operative Treatment</strong></h3><br /><em><strong><a href="http://youtu.be/IMWCNp6-PCg">Watch Video: Ankle Instability- Non-Operative Treatment</a></strong></em>For chronic ankle instability, a combination of the following treatments is often successful at relieving symptoms and minimizing the risk of recurrent ankle sprains:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em>Therapy to strengthen the muscles surrounding the ankle joint: </em>These include exercises to <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/resisted-eversion">strengthen the muscles that evert</a></strong></em> and <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/resisted-inversion">invert</a></strong></em> the ankle, particularly the everting muscles that allow the ankle to resist inversion, including the peroneus longus and peroneus brevis</li><br /> 	<li><em>Therapy to improve ankle <strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/proprioception-exercises">proprioception</a></strong>.</em> or<em> <em>brain ankle coordination</em>: </em>Aggressive therapy to improve proprioception should also be performed.

In addition, patients with significant intra-articular pathology, such as a <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/osteochondral-lesions-of-talus-olt-talar-ocd-talar-ocl">talar OCL</a></strong></em> that are noted on clinical or intraoperative examination to have gross ankle instability, will benefit from stabilization of the attenuated lateral ligamentous structures.Anatomical repair of the outside (lateral) ankle ligaments is one common means of surgically stabilizing the ankle operatively. This procedure, called the <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/lateral-ankle-ligament-repair-reconstruction-brostrom-procedure">Broström procedure</a></strong></em>, involves cutting the stretched out ligaments (anterior talofibular ligament or ATFL and calcaneofibular ligament or CFL) on the outside of the ankle and repairing them in a tightened position.Another operative treatment is a <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/lateral-ligament-reconstruction-with-tendon-graft">tendon reconstruction of the lateral ankle ligaments</a></strong></em>. This more complex procedure involves reinforcing the stretched out ligaments by weaving a tendon graft through bones in the outside of the ankle to provide addional support to this area.A closing <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/calcaneal-osteotomy">calcaneal osteotomy</a></strong></em> may be required to realign the hindfoot in both patients that fail an initial attempt at reconstructing the unstable ankle, or patients with marked inward (varus) hindfoot alignment . This is typically done using a closing wedge calcaneal osteotomy. This procedure involves cutting the heel bone on the outside of the heel bone and correcting the alignment. This bone cut is then stabilized with a screw.<br /><p align="right">Edited on January 17, 2017 (Originally edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/sam-dellenbaugh" target="_blank">Samuel Dellenbaugh, MD</a>)</strong></em></p>
<h4>Edited by <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/jean-brilhault-md-editor/">Jean Brilhault MD</a></h4><br /><h2>Summary:  Sprained Ankle</h2><br />A sprained ankle is one of the most common musculoskeletal injuries. It occurs when the ankle rolls inward leading to tearing of some or all of the ligaments on the outside of the ankle. Risk factors for suffering an ankle sprain include: a history of previous ankle sprains, playing high-risk sports (basketball, volleyball, soccer, etc), and overly loose joints. The severity of an ankle sprain will determine the length of the recovery time.  Initial treatment includes: rest, activity modification, ice, elevation, and compression. Physical therapy that focuses on range of motion and strengthening can be helpful once the initial pain and swelling has settled.<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation:  Ankle Sprain</h2><br />Patients with a sprained ankle typically describe an episode where they roll their ankle to the inside (Figure 1), which creates tearing of the ligaments on the outside aspect of the ankle (Figure 2). Patients typically have significant pain and swelling (Figure 3), and usually limp. However, quite often those who have sprained their ankle are still able to bear some weight.  This is in contrast to patients who have suffered an <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/ankle-fracture/">ankle fracture</a> which makes weight bearing extremely difficult or impossible. With the ankle swollen over the outside (lateral) aspect, there is often associated redness due to the increased blood flow to this area.<br /><div style="width: 200px; float: left;"><br /><h5>Figure 1</h5><br />^media_display_589c294fde9125bcb7693015/position:center^</div><br /><div style="width: 200px; float: left;"><br /><h5>  Figure 2</h5><br /> <br /><h5>^media_display_589c2950de9125bcb7693018/position:center^</h5><br /><h5></h5><br /></div><br /><h5></h5><br /><h5>Figure 3</h5><br /><h4>    ^media_display_589c2951de9125bcb769301b/position:center^</h4><hr /><h2 style="text-align: left;">Physical Examination: Sprained Ankle</h2><br />Physical examination will reveal swelling over the outer aspect of the ankle and tenderness over the outer front aspect of the ankle (Figure 4). Unlike ankle fractures, there is usually no major tenderness over the posterior outside aspect of the ankle. Usually there is no tenderness on the inside of the ankle (medially). It is important to assess for other areas of tenderness and potential injury, as the same mechanism that creates an ankle sprain can also lead to other injuries (ex. fracture of the <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/anterior-process-fracture-of-the-calcaneus/">anterior process of the calcaneus</a>, <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/osteochondral-lesions-of-talus-olt-talar-ocds-talar-ocls/">talar osteochondral injury</a>).<br /><h5>Figure 4: Main area of Tenderness</h5><br />^media_display_589c2953de9125bcb769301e/position:center^<br /><h2>Imaging Studies: Sprained Ankle</h2><br />In the emergency room, x-rays are often taken, however, they are not always indicated. In a patient with an ankle sprain, x-rays will not identify any bony abnormalities and the ankle joint will be well located. If there is no tenderness posteriorly, and the patient is able to take 4 steps, then according to the <em>Ottawa ankle rules</em>, the patient does not require x-rays.<br /><h2>Ankle Sprain Classifications</h2><br />Ankle sprains are typically classified as mild, moderate, and severe. It is often difficult to tell exactly which category the ankle sprain is.<br /><ol><br /> 	<li><em>A <strong>mild ankle sprain</strong></em> involves partial tearing of the <em><strong><a href="/ligaments-of-foot-and-ankle"> anterior talofibular ligament</a> </strong></em>-the first ligament to be stretched when the ankle rolls inwards. In a mild ankle sprain this ligament has tearing of some of the fibers and may be even stretched, but it is intact. Mild ankle sprains will take 4-7 days to achieve most of the recovery.</li><br /> 	<li><em>A <strong>moderate ankle sprain</strong></em> involves a significant tearing of the anterior talofibular ligament and some tearing of the calcaneofibular ligament. Moderate ankle sprains often takes 7-14 days to mostly recover.</li><br /> 	<li><em>A <strong>severe ankle sprain</strong></em> involves disruption of all of the major ligaments on the lateral aspect of the ankle, specifically the anterior talofibular ligament and the calcaneofibular (and much less commonly the posterior talofibular ligament). A severe ankle sprain is a major injury that may take 4-6 weeks, or even longer, to largely recover. Furthermore, in approximately 8-10% of patients suffering a severe ankle sprain, there will be associated injuries to the ankle joint (ex. an <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/osteochondral-lesions-of-talus-olt-talar-ocds-talar-ocls/">osteochondral injury to the talar dome</a>) that may lead to residual symptoms.</li><br /></ol><br /><h2>Treatment: Sprained Ankle</h2><br />The basic treatment of an ankle sprain is the R.I.C.E. approach (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation):<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em><strong>Rest and <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/non-operative-treatment/activity-modification/">Activity Modification</a></strong>:</em> Time is usually the best treatment for a typical ankle sprain. The body just takes time to heal the injured tissue. Resting the injured ankle by limiting activity during the initial healing period is helpful.</li><br /> 	<li><em><strong>Ice</strong>:</em> Applying ice to the injured ankle helps decrease swelling and improves pain control. Ice should be applied 10 minutes on and 10-15 minutes  off repeatedly. Ice helps limit the blood flow to the injured ankle. Normally, increasing the blood flow to an area is a good thing. However, after an ankle sprain, excessive local blood flow leads to too much swelling during the acute phase of the injury</li><br /> 	<li><em><strong>Compression</strong>:</em> Compression helps decrease the swelling. This can be achieved with a compression wrap, such as an Ace bandage.</li><br /> 	<li><em><strong>Elevation</strong></em>:  Elevating the ankle (ex. placing two pillows under the leg while lying) helps to decrease swelling. Having the ankle down (ex. while standing) will tend to increase swelling and pain in the ankle.</li><br /> 	<li><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/non-operative-treatment/non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory-drugs-nsaids/"><strong>Anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs)</strong></a>:</em> Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen can be helpful in decreasing pain following an ankle sprain.  NSAIDs lessen pain by decreasing the inflammatory response to the injury. However, there is some evidence that suggest that anti-inflammatories may have an adverse effect on ligament healing.</li><br /></ul><br /><h3>Subacute Phase</h3><br />Once the symptoms associated with the initial ankle sprain have started to improve, patients will benefit from exercises designed to improve their:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li>Range of Motion (ex. <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/figure-of-eight-exercises">Figure of Eight Exercises</a></strong></em> and Dorsiflexion Stretching)</li><br /> 	<li>Strengthening: Particularly <em><strong><a href="/resisted-eversion">Eversion Strengthening</a></strong></em></li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/proprioception-exercises">Proprioception</a></strong></em></li><br /></ul><br />Surgery is not indicated for the treatment of ankle sprains. The exception would be if there is a displaced cartilage and bone fragment in the ankle joint due to an <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/osteochondral-lesions-of-talus-olt-talar-ocds-talar-ocls/">osteochondral injury to the talus</a></strong></em> (lower bone of the ankle joint).Patients who have recurrent ankle sprains due to <em><strong><a href="/ankle-instability">ankle instability</a></strong></em> may be candidates for an<a href="http://www.footeducation.com/surgical-procedures/lateral-ankle-ligament-repair-reconstruction-brostrom-procedure/"> ankle ligament stabilization procedure</a>.<br /><h3><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Ankle-Sprain-Handout-01-17-2017.pdf">Click here</a> for a summary handout about Ankle Sprains</strong></h3><br /><p>Edited on January 13th, 2017</p><br /><p>Previously edited by <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/michael-shereff-md-editor/">Michael Shereff, MD</a></p>
Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/michael-shereff-md-editor/">Michael Shereff, MD</a></strong></em><br /><h2>Summary</h2><br /><p align="left">The hallmark of anterolateral impingement syndrome of the ankle is pain located in the front of the ankle, at its outermost aspect. This pain can often be made worse when a patient bends over their foot moving forward. This condition is most commonly the result of soft tissue scar buildup in this location after prior injury to the ankle (sprain, fracture), or from an inflammatory process affecting the ankle. The redundant tissue effectively gets pinched or &quot;sandwiched&quot; between the bones as the available space decreases during certain movements (dorsiflexion). The pain is usually quite localized, and pressing on this area while moving the ankle joint will usually reproduce symptoms. Anterolateral ankle impingement is best diagnosed based on a good clinical exam, as well as history taken from an experienced clinician. The pillars of non-operative treatment typically include avoiding aggravating activities, <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/pain-control-post-surgery#ice">icing</a></strong></em>, and/or <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-lacers">bracing the ankle</a></strong></em>. Patients that do not respond to such measures often become candidates for <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-arthroscopy">arthroscopic surgery</a></strong></em>, which is a procedure to clean out the scar tissue in this region of the ankle.</p><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />Pain at the front and outside aspect of the ankle joint (&quot;anterolateral&quot; region) is the main feature of anterolateral ankle impingement. This pain is often precipitated when the leg is bent forward over the ankle (dorsiflexed). There may be a history of a twisting ankle injury in the past. The location of the pain is quite discrete, and can be associated with a fullness or swelling which is very specific to this area (Figure 1). Pressing on the outside (lateral) aspect of the ankle joint line and bringing the foot upwards (dorsiflexing) will usually recreate the symptoms. In some cases, there can be some associated looseness in the ankle joint (<em><strong><a href="/ankle-instability">ankle instability</a></strong></em>) which must also be addressed.<br /><h2>What is the Cause? (Etiology and Pathology)</h2><br />Symptoms from anterolateral ankle impingement occur when there is a build-up of scar tissue in the outer (lateral) aspect of the ankle joint. When the foot is brought upwards, the lower bone of the ankle joint (the talus) jams or “pinches” this tissue buildup between it and the upper bones of the ankle (the fibula and tibia). This can be quite painful. When this occurs, it is classically the result of a prior ankle sprain, whereby patients tear one or several ligaments along the outer aspect of their ankle after inverting or twisting their foot, and these then (in the process of trying to heal) form a large “mass of inflammatory tissue, which should normally not be present.Although several laterally located ligaments in the ankle can be responsible for anterolateral impingement syndrome, the ligament most commonly associated with this problem is called the anterior inferior tibiofibular ligament (one of the ligaments that holds the two bones of the lower leg together at the level of the ankle) (Figure 2). Tearing of the lower bands of this ligament can produce a prominent soft-tissue mass, synovitis, or generalized inflammation in this region, leading to eventual impingement. if it gets big enough. The anterior inferior tibiofibular ligament is the main ligament that is injured in a “high ankle sprain”. Therefore, anterolateral ankle impingement is one possible consequence of a <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/high-ankle-sprain">high ankle sprain</a></strong></em>.<br /><h5>Figure 1:  Anterolateral Impingement: Typical Location of Pain</h5><br />^media_display_589c2954de9125bcb7693022/position:center^<br /><h5>Figure 2:  Scarred Anterior Inferior Tibiofibular Ligament</h5><br />^media_display_589c2956de9125bcb7693025/position:center^<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />In general, anterolateral ankle impingement (or ALIS, as it is sometimes called) will not be identified on plain x-rays, and may also be missed on an MRI. When anterolateral ankle impingement is observed on an MRI, it is usually seen on the axial view (Figure 3).Typically, this diagnosis is made based on the patient's history and the localized tenderness on physical examination. The diagnosis is sometimes confirmed by a diagnostic corticosteroid injection, which can also often be therapeutic. If the symptoms persist, the diagnosis can be confirmed during arthroscopic surgery where the actual jamming (impingement) can be observed (and treated).<br /><h5>Figure 3:  MRI View of Impinging Ligament</h5><br />^media_display_589c2957de9125bcb7693028/position:center^<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br /><h3>Non-Operative Treatment</h3><br />True anterolateral ankle impingement is the result of a physical impediment inside the ankle joint that affects the functioning of the joint. Fortunately, non-operative management is often quite effective in treating this problem. Various treatment options which may be helpful include:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em>Use of a shoe with a slight heel:</em> By using a slightly increased heel, there is less chance that the foot will be forced upward enough to cause the jamming at the joint.</li><br /> 	<li><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/activity-modification"><strong>Activity</strong> <strong>Modification</strong>:</a> </em>Sometimes the most effective treatment is to simply avoid the activities that precipitate symptoms. It is not uncommon for patients with anterolateral ankle impingement to have only certain specific activities (i.e. crouching down) that aggravate symptoms, and if these can be avoided then it may be possible to effectively manage this condition non-operatively.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Using an<strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-lacers"> Ankle Brace</a></strong> or <strong><a href="/ankle-taping">Taping the Ankles</a></strong>:</em> Limiting ankle motion, either by using an ankle brace (<em><strong><a href="/ankle-lacers">ankle lacer</a></strong></em>) or by taping the ankle, will tend to limit ankle motion and may prevent the ankle joint from jamming.</li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/non-operative-treatment/non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory-drugs-nsaids/"><em>Anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs)</em> </a></strong>may decrease the inflammation within the joint and allow the process to subside.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Injecting the Ankle Joint: </em>An injection of corticosteroids into the ankle joint can sometimes help symptoms significantly. If the repetitive jamming has caused the ankle joint lining (symovium) to be inflamed, then a corticosteroid injection may allow this inflamed tissue to settle with resulting improvement in symptoms.</li><br /></ul><br /><h3>Operative Treatment</h3><br />Surgery for true anterolateral ankle impingement ankle joint can be very effective, but should only be considered after attempts at non-operative intervention have failed. When surgery is required to improve this problem, arthroscopy has traditionally been the treatment of choice for the surgeon. <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-arthroscopy">Arthroscopic surgery</a></strong></em> utilizes a tube-like camera and fine custom designed instruments to enter the ankle joint through small &quot;key&quot; holes (Figure 4). The scarring that causes anterolateral ankle impingement can also be removed by larger incisions using a more formal open approach to the ankle, but such additional surgery is generally only favorable if other interventions that cannot be done arthroscopically are required for the ankle at the same time, .<br /><h4><em><strong><a href="/ankle-arthroscopy">Arthroscopic</a></strong></em> Cleaning-out of Anterolateral Ankle Impingement</h4><br />Placing an arthroscope inside the ankle joint allows the surgeon to inspect the entire ankle joint, which is a tremendous advantage in the event that there are other problems elsewhere in the ankle. It also permits direct visualization of the impinging soft-tissue scar when the foot is flexed up (dorsiflexed). Sometimes, the repetitive jamming will have caused some of the cartilage on the outside of the talus (lower bone of the ankle) to be worn away. Sometimes, other ankle problems such as a <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/osteochondral-lesions-of-talus-olt-talar-ocd-talar-ocl">talar osteochondral lesion</a></strong></em> or <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-instability">ankle instability</a></strong></em> will also be found present and will need to be addressed surgically at the same time.<br /><h5>Figure 4:  Arthroscopic View of Scarred Ligament</h5><br />^media_display_589c2958de9125bcb769302b/position:center^<br /><h2>Recovery</h2><br />Surgery for ALIS generally works quite well and can provide a reasonable return to function with good pain relief. If surgery involves only cleaning up the scar tissue along the outer aspect of the ankle, then the recovery is often fairly quick. There is usually a 6-8 week period of increased ankle pain and swelling, during which time the patient may have a limping gait. Full recovery can, however, take 3-6 months or longer.When there are other things going on inside or around the ankle joint (ex. <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/osteochondral-lesions-of-talus-olt-talar-ocd-talar-ocl">Talar OCL</a></strong></em>, <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-arthritis">ankle arthritis</a></strong></em> , <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/peroneal-tendonitis">peroneal tendonitis</a></strong></em>, <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-instability">ankle instability</a></strong></em>, etc.) that necessitate correction at the same time, recovery could take much longer, even though the outcome can still be very promising for many patients. The implications and severity of these additional findings can obviously affect long-term outcome, however, and so they should always be discussed with your doctor both before and after any surgical intervention.<br /><h2>Potential Surgical Complications</h2><br /><h4><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications">General Complications</a></strong></em></h4><br />This type of arthroscopic surgery typically has a very low complication rate, and the procedure is typically performed as an outpatient (not overnight) procedure. However, as with all orthopedic surgery, risks include:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#infection">Infection</a></strong></em></li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems">Wound healing problems</a></strong></em></li><br /> 	<li>Blood Clots or <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#pe">Pulmonary Embolism</a></strong></em></li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#nerve-injury">Nerve irritation or injury</a></strong></em> (An indirect injury to the superficial peroneal nerve, leading to neuritis or neuroma)</li><br /> 	<li>Traction injury (tendonitis or skin irritation/abrasion from the distraction used to get a good look inside the joint space)</li><br /> 	<li>Persistent symptoms.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>Edited on January 10, 2017 (Originally edited by <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/paul-juliano-md-editor"><strong><em>Paul Juliano, MD</em></strong></a>)</p><br />

This can be painful, especially if it rubs against a tight fitting shoe. A bunionette occurs when the bone of the midfoot (metatarsal) angles out and the little toe (phalanx) angles in, resulting in a bony prominence. Non-surgical treatment is often successful and includes: wearing proper shoes with space to accommodate the bump; correcting the little toe deformity with a toe spacer; or padding the prominence to prevent irritation. Surgery is an option when non-operative treatment is unsuccessful.<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />A Bunionette is a deformity at the base of the fifth or little toe (Figures 1 &amp; 2), which tends to occur gradually over time. Patients with bunionette deformities experience localized pain on the outside aspect of the base of the fifth toe.<br /><table style="width: 600px; border: none !important;"><br /><tbody><br /><tr><br /><td style="border: none !important;"><br /><h5>Figure 1: Bunionette Deformity</h5><br /></td><br /><td style="border: none !important;"><br /><h5>Figure 2: Pre-op x-ray</h5><br /></td><br /></tr><br /><tr><br /><td style="border: none !important;">^media_display_589c2959de9125bcb769302f/position:center^</td><br /><td style="border: none !important;"><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Bunionette-Preop-AP-X-rayjpg.png">^media_display_589c295ade9125bcb7693032/position:center^</a></td><br /></tr><br /></tbody><br /></table><br /><h2>Physical Examination</h2><br />Physical examination will show a deformity of the fifth toe with a prominence on the outside at the base. There can be swelling in this area representing a bursa, which is a fluid-filled sac. The fifth toe itself usually has a normal range of motion. The sensation and blood supply of the foot is typically normal. Sometimes, patients also have a <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/bunions-hallux-valgus">bunion</a></strong></em> of the big toe.<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />Standing plain x-rays show the bony alignment that is responsible for the observed deformity. There is usually an angular deformity at the fifth metatarsophalangeal joint, which corresponds to the base of the fifth toe. In some patients, the problem is a metatarsal bone (the long bones of the mid-foot) that angles outward as well as the toe leaning inward.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br /><h3>Non-Operative Treatment</h3><br />Most of the cases of bunionette deformity can be managed nonoperatively. Non-operative treatment includes:<br /><ol><br /> 	<li><em>Use of <strong><a href="/comfort-shoes">comfort shoes</a></strong>: </em>Shoes with a wider toebox and comfortable soft leather upper can be helpful in managing this deformity. Occasionally, it is beneficial to have a shoemaker create extra space in this area to accommodate the deformity.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Comfort pads: </em>Pads can be applied over the outside aspect of the bunionette deformity to make this area more comfortable. For example, a C-shaped pad can help protect the prominent area.  However, applying a pad may necessitate creating increased space within the front of the shoe.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Toe spacer: </em>A toe spacer can be placed between the fourth and fifth toe to help reduce the deformity and improve the patient's symptoms.</li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="/activity-modification">Activity modifications</a></strong>: </em>If the deformity is severe enough, it may be necessary to limit the amount of time that the individual stands or walks.</li><br /></ol><br /><h3>Operative Treatment</h3><br />In a small percentage of patients, operative treatment will be beneficial. Surgery should only be considered after nonoperative management has failed. The type of operative treatment is dependent upon the actual deformity. Operative options for treating bunionette deformities include:<br /><ol><br /> 	<li><em>Removal of the prominent bone on the outer aspect of the fifth metatarsal head: </em>In some individuals with a bunionette deformity, the outside aspect of the fifth metatarsal head is prominent and simply removing this will help the symptoms.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Cutting and repositioning the fifth metatarsal bone: </em>In most patients with significant bunionette deformities, there is an increased angle between the fourth and the fifth metatarsal with the subsequent increased deformity at the fifth toe (metatarso-phalangeal) joint. In these individuals, a formal cutting and repositioning of the bone (osteotomy) of the fifth metatarsal is necessary. Depending upon the exact nature of the deformity, the bone can be cut close to the bunionette or further up the foot to reposition the entire bone, These procedures are combined with a soft tissue tightening of the outer (lateral) joint capsule of the fifth metatarsophalangeal joint, further correcting the deformity.</li><br /></ol><br /><table style="border: none !important;"><br /><tbody><br /><tr><br /><td style="border: none !important;"><br /><h5>Figure 3: Bunionette Lateral x-ray post-op</h5><br /></td><br /><td style="border: none !important;"><br /><h5>Figure 4: AP x-ray post-op</h5><br /></td><br /></tr><br /><tr><br /><td style="border: none !important;"><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Bunionette-Lateral-x-ray-post-op.png">^media_display_589c295bde9125bcb7693035/position:center^</a></td><br /><td style="border: none !important;"><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Bunionette-AP-X-ray-Post-op.png">^media_display_589c295dde9125bcb7693038/position:center^</a></td><br /></tr><br /></tbody><br /></table><br /><h3>Potential Operative Complications</h3><br />Potential post-operative complications include <em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications">general surgical complications</a></strong></em> such as:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#infection">Infection</a></strong></em></li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems">Wound healing problems</a></strong></em></li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#nerve-injury">Nerve injury</a></strong></em></li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#dvt">Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)</a></strong></em></li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#pe">Pulmonary Embolism</a> </strong></em></li><br /></ul><br /><strong>Specific complications</strong> associated with a bunionette correction include:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li>Recurrence of the Deformity</li><br /> 	<li>Continued (or even increased) local pain</li><br /> 	<li>Vascular Injury (including potential loss of blood supply to fifth toe)</li><br /></ul><br /><div></div><br /><p>Edited on July 16, 2015 (Previously Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/robert-leland-md-editor/" target="_blank">Robert Leland, MD</a></strong></em>)</p>
Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/michael-shereff-md-editor" target="_blank">Michael Shereff, MD</a></strong></em> <br /><h2>Summary</h2><br /><p class="summary">A typical depressed calcaneal fracture (Figure 1) is perhaps the most serious common foot injury. Depressed (crushed) calcaneal fractures occur when the heel is directly or indirectly loaded with excessive force, such as in a fall from a height or in a motor vehicle accident where the heel may be driven into the floorboard. There are both non-operative and operative treatments available for this injury. Operative treatment allows for the bone fragments to be repositioned so that they can heal in an improved position (it does not speed bone healing which usually takes 8-12 weeks). However, surgery requires a high degree of skill and experience on the part of the surgeon. Surgical complications such as wound breakdown or deep infection are not uncommon, and can be extremely serious. Complications are higher in patients who are smokers, diabetics, have vascular disease, or who have excessive swelling. The long-term prognosis is somewhat guarded with both operative treatment and non-operative treatment, with some hindfoot stiffness and pain being common.</p><h5>Figure 1A:  X-ray of foot showing a normal calcaneus from the side</h5><br />^media_display_589c295ede9125bcb769303c/position:center^<br /><h5>Figure 1B:  X-ray of a depressed calcaneus fracture</h5><br />^media_display_589c295fde9125bcb769303f/position:center^<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation:  Calcaneus Fractures</h2><br />Patients who have suffered a calcaneus fracture present with acute pain and a large amount of swelling over the heel. They are usually unable to bear weight on the involved foot. The fracture itself occurs when the the lower bone of the ankle (talus) gets driven into the upper part of the heel bone (calcaneus). This causes the calcaneus to break (Figure 2). Therefore falls from a height where the patient lands on their feet is a common mechanism leading to a calcaneus fracture.  The calcaneal bone is somewhat analogous to a complicated shaped egg. It has a hard shell (cortical bone) on the outside, and very soft, cancellous bone in the inside. When it breaks, there is a primary fracture line running from the inside distal part of the calcaneus to the outside hind part of the calcaneus (Figure 3)<br /><h5>Figure 2A:  Mechanism of Typical Calcaneal fracture - Side view</h5><br />^media_display_589c2961de9125bcb7693042/position:center^<br /><h5>Figure 2B: Mechanism of Typical Calcaneal fracture - Viewed from the back</h5><br />^media_display_589c2962de9125bcb7693045/position:center^<br /><h5>Figure 3: Primary Fracture line viewed from the top (also showing secondary fracture lines)</h5><br />^media_display_589c2964de9125bcb7693048/position:center^In addition, there is often a series of other fracture lines. The calcaneus, in many ways, breaks the same way as an egg would break into a number of different pieces. The fracture pattern will vary for each patient and injury.<br /><h2>Physical Examination related to Calcaneal Fractures</h2><br />In patients with calcaneus fractures the physical examination usually demonstrates tremendous swelling around the involved heel. In some patients, there will be a break in the skin, representing an open fracture. Open fractures constitute an orthopedic emergency. Usually, the sensation in the foot is intact. In addition, blood supply to the foot is usually intact, although this does need to be assessed following the injury. It is also common to have other injuries, such as a fracture involving the ankle or another part of the foot. A Lumbar spine burst fracture will occur in about 10% of patients who suffer a calcaneal fracture. This is a fracture in the lower to mid back which essentially crushes one of the vertebras. The same mechanism that produces a calcaneal fracture will predispose a patient to having a lumbar burst fracture.<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />X-rays are helpful when a calcaneal fracture is suspected. Typically, a lateral x-ray demonstrating the foot from the side (Figure 4), as well as an axillary heel view showing an end-on view of the heel are taken. This allows the basic fracture pattern to be identified.<br /><h5>Figure 4: X-ray of fractured calcaneus from the side</h5><br />^media_display_589c2965de9125bcb769304b/position:center^To more thoroughly understand the fracture pattern, particularly if surgery is a possibility, a CT scan will be ordered (Figure 5). On the CT scan, the number of fracture lines extending through the posterior facet of the calcaneus is important.<br /><h5>Figure 5: CT scan of fractured calcaneus</h5><br />^media_display_589c2967de9125bcb769304e/position:center^<br /><h2>Treatment of Calcaneus Fractures</h2><br /><h3>Non-Operative Treatment</h3><br />Calcaneal fractures can be quite difficult to treat, and the recovery can be prolonged. It is not uncommon and, in fact, may be the norm to have some element of post-traumatic <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/subtalar-arthritis/">subtalar arthritis</a> as a result of this injury.Non-operative management of calcaneal fractures does not mean NO treatment. Non-operative management includes a prolonged period of non-weight bearing to allow the fracture to heal. This typically needs 10-12 weeks to allow the calcaneal fracture to be healed enough to bare weight. During that time, the patient is treated with appropriate pain control. This includes elevation to limit swelling, ice to decrease the swelling and improve local symptoms, and narcotic pain medication.An important active part of non-operative management is early work to optimize range of motion. This means that after the initial swelling subsides (usually 7-14 days), the patient will be instructed to perform daily range of motion exercises aimed at optimizing the amount of motion in the ankle, subtalar, and transverse tarsal joints. These exercises are often as simple as drawing out a <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/foot-and-ankle-physical-therapy/figure-of-eight-exercises/">figure-of-eight</a> with the big toe, as well as using a towel over the toes to bring the foot up towards the shin (dorsiflexing the ankle).A large study has suggested that results of non-operative treatment are only marginally worse than the results of operative treatment, when all the patients are considered (Buckley et al JBJS Sept 2003). If a patient is at high-risk of operative complication, non-operative treatment should be employed as the risks of operative treatment for this injury can be quite severe. Patients who smoke, are diabetic, have vascular disease, have an active Worker's compensation claim, or are older, are thought to have a higher risk of complications and/or poor outcome.<br /><h3>Operative Treatment</h3><br />Operative treatment involves reconstructing the shattered calcaneus, essentially trying to return the calcaneus to the pre-injury shape. For each patient, this treatment needs to be individualized. The operative procedure is technically difficult, and can be associated with an unacceptably high complication rate. It is therefore important that the surgeon involved have confidence and experience with these types of fractures. Operating through excessively swollen tissue has been shown to significantly increase the risk of wound healing problems and infection. For this reason, it is now standard practice to wait until the soft-tissues swelling has settled, often 10-14 or more days after the injury. The worst results of calcaneal fracture treatment occur when an operatively treated fracture is complicated by a bad, deep infection or a significant wound breakdown. It is not unheard of in these situations where the patient will eventually require an amputation.Operative treatment is performed usually through an incision on the outside of the heel. The fracture fragments of the calcaneus are systematically reduced back into the original position. If they cannot be anatomically reduced, this will significantly reduce the effectiveness of the surgery, often to the point where non-operative management should be undertaken. After the bones have been repositioned, they are fixated with a combination of screws and plates (Figure 6). The fixation is customized depending upon the fracture pattern.<br /><h5>Figure 6: Calcaneus following surgical fixation</h5><br />^media_display_589c2969de9125bcb7693051/position:center^With certain fracture patterns, it is possible to perform a percutaneous procedure. Percutaneous treatment (operating without making a large incision) involves skewering part of the fracture with a straight wire (K-wire), and manipulating it into an improved position. This is done through a few stab incisions. Unfortunately, less than 10% of the calcaneal fractures fit into this category, and most require a large, open procedure if the bone fragments are to be adequately repositioned (reduced). Tongue-type fractures occur when the posterior facet remains in continuity with the posterior aspect of the calcaneus, forming what looks like a tongue. These are the types of fractures that would be potentially amenable to percutaneous repair.<br /><h5>Figure 7: Calcaneus following percutaneous repair</h5><br />^media_display_589c296ade9125bcb7693054/position:center^Following surgery, the recovery time is similar to that for non-operative treatment. Essentially, the patient needs 10-12 weeks of non-weight bearing to allow the fracture to heal. However, within 2 weeks of surgery some basic non-weight bearing range of motion exercises should be instituted, in order to limit the hindfoot stiffness.<br /><h3>Surgical Complications</h3><br />Complications of operative treatment are not uncommon. The major complications include:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em>Deep wound infection:</em> Because of the tenuous skin over the outside of the heel, any type of wound infection commonly goes down to the bone potentially leading to osteomylelitis (bone infection).</li><br /> 	<li><em>Wound healing</em> can be an issue because the soft-tissue on the outside of the heel has a tenuous blood supply. Meticulous wound closure is required to minimize the risk of this problem.</li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/sural-neuritis/">Sural Neuritis</a></strong>:</em> The sural nerve, which innervates the outside of the foot, is often stretched or injured in the surgical approach, and can become scarred or injured in the course of the surgery.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Nonunion of the calcaneus</em> is possible, although it is uncommon.</li><br /> 	<li><strong><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/subtalar-arthritis/">Subtalar arthritis</a></em> </strong>is not so much a complication as it is a common long-term effect of the injury, leading to pain and stiffness in the hindfoot. This will manifest itself with symptoms when the patient stands for a prolonged period of time, or walks on uneven ground. This could be a problematic symptom for patients that are on their feet a lot. For these patients, it may even be necessary to eventually perform a primary subtalar fusion.</li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#dvt"><em>Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)</em></a></strong></li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#pe"><em>Pulmonary Embolism</em></a></strong></li><br /></ul><br /><h3><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/06-15-2014-Calcaneal-Fractures-Handout-edited-by-K-HuntB.pdf">Click Here</a> for a summary handout on Calcaneal Fractures</h3><br /><p>Edited on January 17, 2017</p>

Calf muscle tears have similar symptoms and occur by a similar mechanism to <em><strong><a href="/achilles-tendon-rupture">Achilles tendon ruptures</a></strong></em>. The difference is the location of the injury. Achilles tendon ruptures involve the actual Achilles tendon with pain located just above the back of the heel. Calf muscle tears occur higher up where the muscle belly attaches to the fascia (musculotendinous junction). Figure 1 shows the typical location of each injury. Because of the similarities between the injuries, an Achilles tendon rupture must be ruled out in the diagnosis. Treatment of calf muscle tears is non-surgical. In most instances, initial treatment includes activity modification (limiting muscle-loading activities), wearing a boot (Cam Walker), and using crutches.  As the muscle tear heals, physical therapy exercises are utilized to regain full range of motion and muscular strength. Significant improvement can be expected within the first two weeks, but full recovery can take up to 6-8 weeks. It may take many more months to regain muscle mass in the calf that had been atrophied (weakened) due to lack of use.</p><h5>Figure 1: Typical Location of Calf Tear vs Achilles Tendon rupture</h5><br />^media_display_589c296bde9125bcb7693058/position:center^<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation of Calf Muscle Tears</h2><br />Calf (Gastrocnemius) muscle tears typically occur in moderately active individuals (“weekend warriors”) while performing actions that put maximal tension on the gastrocnemius muscle. The term “weekend warriors” describes individuals who work hard during the week and play hard on the weekends. This lack of consistent physical activity leads to loss of strength and flexibility in the muscles, tendons and ligaments thereby increasing the chance of injury. However, even professional athletes may sustain a calf muscle tear.The mechanism of injury is very similar to that of an <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/achilles-tendon-rupture/">Achilles tendon rupture</a>, which must be ruled out in the diagnosis. Calf tears often occur while performing actions that require forceful shortening (contraction) or sudden lengthening of the calf muscle (ex: basketball, hill running, tennis, “missing a step”, etc.). The exact location of this injury is where the muscle belly attaches to the fascia (musculotendinous junctions) of the Achilles tendon. These tears most commonly involve the inside portion (medial head) of the gastrocnemius muscle as this region is under the greatest amount of tension. Patients with Gastrocnemius muscle tears usually describe a sudden, sharp pain on the inside aspect of the lower calf region. Immediately after suffering a calf tear, patients will walk with a painful limp. Bruising and swelling in the calf area will often develop over the next 24-36 hours.<br /><h2>Physical Examination related to Calf Muscle Tears</h2><br />Clinical examination of a calf muscle tear will find acute tenderness upon palpation to the entire inside aspect of the calf muscle (medial gastrocnemius muscle). This tenderness will be significantly more painful at the lower aspect of the calf. Depending on the degree of bruising and swelling, a palpable defect in the muscle may be evident.Stretching of the ankle in an upward direction (dorsiflexion) will produce moderate to severe pain (due to stretching of the torn muscle fibers). Similar pain will be noted with downward ankle motion (ankle plantar flexion), due to the contraction of the torn muscle fibers. These torn calf muscle fibers will produce pain if the patient attempts to perform a calf raise or walk on tip toes. During the initial phase of the injury, patients will walk with a limp.As a calf muscle tear can mimic an Achilles tendon rupture, a careful physical exam is essential to differentiate between these two injuries. One important physical exam component is called the Thompson Squeeze Test. This test involves a gentle squeeze of the calf muscle. If the squeeze produces a characteristic foot motion (plantar flexion), the Achilles tendon is intact. Achilles tendon rupture occurs below the typical location of a calf muscle tear (Figure 1) and is associated with a palpable defect in the actual Achilles tendon.<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />Plain x-rays may be necessary if your physician wishes to assess the underlying bone. If there is a question as to whether the Achilles tendon is involved, an MRI may be indicated. An MRI is able to accurately assess the soft tissue and differentiate between an injury to the Achilles tendon and the calf muscle tear.<br /><h2>Treatment of Calf Muscle Tears</h2><br />Treatment of Gastrocnemius muscle tears is usually non-surgical, and dependent upon the individual’s symptoms. In most instances, initial treatment includes <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/non-operative-treatment/activity-modification/">activity modification</a> (limiting muscle-loading activities), wearing a boot (<a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/foot-and-ankle-medical-supplies/cam-walker-walking-boot/">Cam Walker</a>), and <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/foot-and-ankle-medical-supplies/crutches/">using crutches</a>.  As the muscle tear heals, physical therapy exercises are utilized to regain full range of motion and muscular strength. Significant improvement can be expected within the first two weeks, but full recovery can take up to 6-8 weeks. It may take many more months to regain muscle mass in the calf. Occasionally, excessive scarring will form in the location of the tear. This can cause chronic pain in the area, or render it more likely for future tearing as the fibrotic scar tissue absorbs forces differently than regular healthy muscle tissue.<br /><h4>Initial (Acute Phase) Treatment</h4><br />Immediately after the injury (first 24-72 hours) treatment should include:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em>Relative rest</em>. Limit the use of the injured calf, by limiting standing and walking and possibly using crutches if needed.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Ice</em> applied to the injured area (10 minutes on, 10 minutes off and then repeat)</li><br /> 	<li><em>Compression</em>. Light compression with a wrap may be helpful</li><br /> 	<li><em>Elevation</em>. Elevate the leg at, or slightly above, the level of the heart. For example, by lying on a bed with the foot propped up by a couple pillows.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Gentle foot and ankle range of motion (ROM) exercises</em> can be carried out as long as the motion is relatively pain-free</li><br /> 	<li><em>Immobilize the ankle in a neutral position</em>. Studies have shown an increased rate of healing with the ankle braced in a neutral position (ex. foot at a right angle to the lower leg). Your physician may recommend placing your leg in a splint (soft cast) or boot to achieve this position. A splint or boot also serves to protect the injury.</li><br /></ul><br /><h4>Recovery Phase</h4><br />Once pain free, the patient should progress from gentle plantar flexion (downward motion) exercises against resistance (use of resistance bands), to gradual introduction of stationary cycling, leg presses, and heel raises. Massage techniques can help to decrease swelling and prevent formation of scar tissue.<br /><h4>Maintenance Phase</h4><br />Once pain-free strength and flexibility have returned, sport-specific activities can be introduced. The long-term goal of rehabilitation is to overcome the increased risk for re-injury by minimizing scar tissue formation and maximizing muscle strength and function. <em><strong><a href="/double-leg-heel-rises">Calf strengthening</a></strong></em> and <em><strong><a href="/calf-stretch">calf stretching</a></strong></em> should continue for several months.<br /><p>Edited November 17, 2016 (Previously edited by  <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/matthew-buchanan-md-editor/">Matthew Buchanan, MD</a></strong></em>)</p>
Edited by <strong><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/haley-merrill-md/">Haley Merrill, MD</a></em></strong><br /><h2>Summary</h2><br /><p class="summary">Charcot-Marie Tooth (CMT) disease is a condition that commonly produces a high arched foot (Figure 1). It was described independently by Jean-Martin Charcot, Pierre Marie, and Howard Henry Tooth in 1886. It is also known as Hereditary Sensorimotor Neuropathy (HSMN), or Peroneal Muscular Atrophy. CMT is associated with weakness of the lower extremity muscles. It is caused by abnormalities in nerve conduction (too much myelin in the nerve sheath). CMT is usually inherited, and therefore a positive family history is common - although up to a quarter of the cases can arise spontaneously. The foot deformities and symptoms related to CMT are typically progressive - they tend to worsen over time. However, the rate at which they worsen can vary greatly. Some patients are able to function at a high level throughout their lives (mild cases), whereas some develop debilitating foot (and sometimes hand) symptoms relatively early (severe cases).</p><h4>Figure 1:  Typical Charcot-Marie-Tooth Foot Deformity</h4><br />^media_display_589c296cde9125bcb769305c/position:center^<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />The clinical manifestations of CMT can vary widely. The most common complaints are those associated with high arched feet, loose ankles, and muscle weakness. These include a propensity to suffer:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li>Recurrent <em><strong><a href="/sprained-ankle">ankle sprains</a></strong></em></li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="/ankle-instability">Ankle instability</a></strong></em></li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="/jones-fracture-5th-metatarsal-stress-fracture">Jones fractures of the 5th Metatarsal</a></strong></em></li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="/peroneal-tendonitis">Peroneal tendonitis</a></strong></em></li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/sesamoiditis">Seasmoiditis</a></strong></em></li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="/drop-foot">Drop foot</a></strong></em> (in more severe cases)</li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="/ankle-arthritis">Ankle arthritis</a></strong></em> (later in life)</li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/claw-toes">Claw toe deformities</a></strong></em></li><br /></ul><br />It is not uncommon to have noticeable clawing of the toes (including the big toe) in patients with CMT.<br /><h2>Physical Examination</h2><br />Muscle testing may reveal muscle weakness. Commonly, the ability to bring the foot inwards (inversion) is stronger that the ability to move the foot outward (eversion). Also, the ability to push the foot down (plantar flexion) is stronger than the ability to lift the foot up (dorsiflexion).There is a classic set of muscle imbalances that leads to the common Charcot-Marie-Tooth foot deformities. These four muscle imbalances include:<br /><ol><br /> 	<li><i>The Peroneus Brevis is weaker than the Tibialis Posterior muscle.</i> This leads to a greater inward pull of the foot (inversion).</li><br /> 	<li><i>The Tibialis anterior muscle is weaker than the Peroneus Longus muscle. </i>This creates the high arch by pulling the forefoot down.</li><br /> 	<li><i>The intrinsic foot muscles (</i>the small muscles in the sole of the foot that help move the toes<i>) are weaker than the extrinsic muscles</i> (the larger muscles in the lower leg that cross the ankle joint and help move the toes). This muscle imbalance leads to clawing of the toes, including the great toe.</li><br /> 	<li><i>The Anterior compartment muscles (the muscles at the front of the shin bone or tibia) </i>are weaker than the calf muscles. This can lead to a drop foot.</li><br /></ol><br />Skin sensation of the foot (the ability to feel things) can sometimes be affected in more severe cases.<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />Weight-bearing x-rays of the foot and ankle will show evidence of a high arched foot pattern. Classically, the heel bone will have an elevated angle relative to the ground and the 1st metatarsal bone (the bone the big toe is attached to) will be pointed down (Figure 2).<br /><h4>Figure 2:  Typical Charot-Marie-Tooth Foot X-rays</h4><br />^media_display_589c296dde9125bcb769305f/position:center^^media_display_589c296fde9125bcb7693062/position:center^<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br />Treatment of CMT has focused on helping the symptoms created by the deformity. To date, no treatment has been shown to fix the actual nerve problem.  If the foot and ankle are flexible, and there is no arthritis in the joints, it is more likely that the procedures recommended will aim to rebalance and realign the foot, while preserving motion. If the foot and ankle are stiff, or if there is arthritis in the joints, it is more likely that the procedures recommended will aim to fuse the joints in a better position.<br /><h3>Non-Operative Treatment</h3><br />Non-operative treatment focuses on controlling/correcting the foot deformities, maintaining muscle strength, preventing ankle sprains, and controlling pain symptoms. Treatments often include:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="/ankle-lacers">Ankle Lacer</a></strong>:</em> This can be an effective brace to help hold the ankle stable, and may improve ankle symptoms in patients with mild to moderate foot</li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="/ankle-foot-orthosis-afo">Ankle-Foot-Orthotic (AFO)</a></strong>: </em>An AFO can be used to improve symptoms in patients with more pronounced deformities or more extensive hindfoot arthritis, by supporting the foot and holding it very stable.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Orthotic insert: </em>A shoe insert with a low spot under the big toe and/or raised area under the outside of the heel and midfoot, can help to reposition the foot in patients who still have some flexibility<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">.</span></li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-physical-therapy">Physical Therapy</a></strong>:</em>Physical Therapy to improve muscle strength and proprioception (the ability of your brain to understand where your ankle is in space relative to your body) can help protect against future ankle sprains, and serve to improve overall function.</li><br /> 	<li>For patients with tendonitis or arthritis symptoms, NSAIDs can help to decrease pain and improve their overall function</li><br /></ul><br /><h3>Operative Treatment</h3><br />Operative treatment is often performed to help correct the foot deformity. It is important to understand that the foot deformities occur because of the muscle imbalances that affect the foot, so it may be necessary to transfer tendons (and their muscles) to help rebalance the foot. Surgery for Charcot-Marie-Tooth foot deformities must be individualized for each patient based on their deformity, their muscle function, and their age. Often, a combination of procedures are needed and are often performed at the same time.

This condition can create symptoms in one or all of three places:<br /><ol><br /> 	<li>On the top of the toes if they rub against the shoes</li><br /> 	<li>On the tips of the toes if they jam in to the soles of the shoes</li><br /> 	<li>At the base of the toes (metatarsophalagenal (MTP) joints) as they become subluxed (displaced partially out of joint)</li><br /></ol><br />In addition, claw toes are often associated with forefoot pain (metatarsalgia), as the MTP joints commonly become displaced in patients with pronounced claw toes. Subluxation is the upward displacement of the toe relative to the metarsal head or “ball of the foot.” This leaves the metatarsal heads prominent and subject to excessive overload. Patients with this problem often describe &quot;walking on marbles.&quot;<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />Claw toes result from an inherent muscle imbalance. It is common for patients to develop claw toes as they get older. It is particularly common if there is a family history of the condition. Patients develop claw toes when the long muscles originating from the lower leg overpower the smaller muscles in the foot. This imbalance leads to flexion at the proximal interphalangeal joint, and extension at the metatarsal phalangeal joint, creating the clawing effect. This condition can also occur in post-traumatic situations, when there is an injury to one of the tendons or if there is a <em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/compartment-syndrome-of-the-foot/">compartment syndrome</a></em> affecting the small muscles of the foot. Commonly, clawing of the toes develop if the calf muscles are tight. If the calf is tight, there is recruitment of the muscle that pulls the toes upward, the extensor digitorum longus, to assist in pulling the foot up to clear the ground while walking in preparation for the next step.Clawtoe deformities typically involve all four lesser toes (toes 2-5). It is not uncommon for the second toe to have the most pronounced deformity, but a close look at all four toes will often demonstrate that the deformity is present in each toe (See Figure 1). It is uncommon for the big toe to develop clawing, although this does happen in certain conditions, including <em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-cmt-foot-deformities">Charcot Marie Tooth disease</a></em>.The term hammertoe is almost synonymous with claw toes. The main difference between these two conditions is the position of the distal interphalangeal joint (DIP joint). In hammertoes this joint is extended and in a claw toe it is flexed. However, it can sometimes be difficult to clinically differentiate between the two.<br /><h5>Figure 1: Claw toe deformities</h5><br /><h3><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/clawtoes-Figure-1.jpg">^media_display_589c2970de9125bcb7693066/position:center^</a></h3><br /><h2>Physical Examination</h2><br />On physical examination, the physician will want to identify the main areas of tenderness. This will give some indication as to the cause of the pain. If the tenderness is on the top of the toes and is associated with some callus formation, symptoms are likely from direct pressure on the top (dorsal aspect) of the toe. If tenderness occurs on the tip of the toe, this may be from pressure of the tip of the toe (“hammering”) into the sole of the shoe. In addition, whether or not the toes are flexible or fixed is important. Each joint will be evaluated to assess whether this joint can return to its normal position. The overall alignment of the toes is important, as well as the sensation, motor function, and blood supply of the toes.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br /><h3>Non-Operative Treatment</h3><br />Most claw toe deformities can be treated non-operatively. The literature describes a number of potential treatments including:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em>Applying pads to the area involved.</em> There are numerous commercially available devices, which can be highly effective in reducing the deformity and providing padding or off-loading the areas of prominence.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Toe spacers and Hammer toe splints </em>(Figure 2). Some commercially available products splint the toes in an improved position. These devices may only provide short term correction of the toe deformity, but for many patients this can improve their symptoms when the walk and use shoes.</li><br /> 	<li><em>The use of the wide and deep-toe box.</em> A shoe with more room up front might be better able to accommodate the deformity and make a huge difference in the patient's symptoms.</li><br /> 	<li><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/pre-fabricated-over-the-counter-orthotics-insert">A soft pre-fabricated orthotic</a></em> to create cushioning over the toe region can be helpful, particularly if the symptoms occur at the tip of the toes.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Trimming painful calluses.</em> If prominent calluses have developed, trimming these back on a regular basis can be very helpful.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Dynamic intrinsic muscle exercises.</em> This has been proposed as a way to lessen the progression of claw toe deformity. Exercises, such as trying to pick up tissues with the toes, may be beneficial to keep the toes supple.</li><br /></ul><br /><h5>Figure 2: Hammer toe splint</h5><br />^media_display_589c2972de9125bcb7693069/position:center^<br /><h3>Operative Treatment</h3><br />Surgery is occasionally recommended to correct claw toes that cannot be successfully treated non-operatively. There are a variety of procedures that have been described, and often a combination of procedures is performed. Because the deformity occurs as a result of a muscle imbalance, tendon transfer or lengthening may be needed in order to enact a long-term correction and minimize the risk of a recurrence. Common procedures that may be used in combination with others include:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em>Straightening the Toe (Proximal Interphalangeal (PIP) joint resection)</em>. If there is a fixed deformity at the PIP joint (the first &quot;knuckle&quot; of the toe), this joint can be removed, or repositioned in a straightened position and then fused with some type of fixation, often a wire insert through the toe. This joint may not fully heal with bone, but even a fibrous union (scar tissue) in a straight position will be effective.</li><br /> 	<li><em>MTP joint (joint at he base of the toe) soft tissue release (capsulorraphy/capsulotomy)</em>. Because the MTP joint flexes up, the top part of the joint capsule (soft tissue) becomes very stiff and contracted. It is often necessary to release this, in order for the joint to fall back into the normal position. The MTP joint is held with a temporary wire in the new &quot;straighter&quot; position.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Extensor tendon lengthening.</em> Often the tendons that pull the toe upwards (long extensor tendons originating from the extensor digitorum longus muscle) will become contracted and tight. These tendons can be lengthened or simply released to allow the toes to fall back into an improved position. If released the little toe extensor may be anchored to the foot so the associated muscle, the extensor digitorum longus, can assist in dorsiflexion of the foot.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Flexor to extensor tendon transfer [Girdlestone-Taylor procedure].</em> This procedure involves a release of one of the tendons that pulls the toe downwards (the flexor digitorum longus) at the tip of the toe (distally), and a transfer of this tendon to the top of the toe (dorsal aspect of the proximal phalanx). This procedure aims to convert one of the primary deforming forces leading to clawing of the toes into a force that helps correct the deformity. It produces a fairly predictable correction of the toes, however, the surgery is slightly more involved than some of the other procedures.</li><br /></ul><br /><h2>Recovery from Surgery</h2><br />It is important to understand that the <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">recovery from any toe surgery is often more prolonged than a patient expects</span></em>. During the healing process, an increase in blood flow to the involved toe occurs. This creates swelling and pain. This could persist for many weeks or even months. It is common to still have swelling and stiffness in the toes 4-6 months post-surgery. The patient should be prepared to limit their activity for a period that is often longer than they think, or would like.<br /><h2>Potential Complications</h2><br /><h3>General Complications</h3><br />The usual list of general post-surgical complications may occur with a claw toe correction. This includes the potential for<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems">wound healing problems</a></li><br /> 	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#infection">infection</a></li><br /> 	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#non-union">nonunion</a> (if the PIP joint is fused)</li><br /> 	<li>local nerve injury to the nerves that provide sensation to the tips of the toes</li><br /> 	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#dvt">Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)</a> - very uncommon</li><br /> 	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#pe">Pulmonary Embolism (PE)</a> - very uncommon</li><br /></ul><br /><h3>Specific Complications</h3><br />Complications that are specific to claw toe corrections include:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em>Malunion</em>: It is common for the toe to heal in a position that may not be perfectly straight. Minor degrees of deformity will be mostly a cosmetic concern, which is why almost all surgeons discourage patients from having toe surgery if the concerns are mostly cosmetic. In severe cases, the toe may be significantly malpositioned, even to the point where further surgery is required.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Recurrence of the Deformity</em>: Other complications include failure to fully correct the claw toe deformity, or the potential for recurrence of the deformity over time.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Loss of blood supply to the tip of the toe:</em> The blood supply to the tip of the toe can be tenuous. There are two small arteries (one on either side of the toe) which supply blood to the tip of the toe. It is not uncommon for one of these vessels to be absent. If the blood supply to the tip of the toe is lost the tissue will die and it may be necessary to amputate part, or all of the toe.</li><br /> 	<li>Stiffness: It is not possible to straighten a clawtoe and have the involved joints move normally. A good surgical outcome is a stiff, straight toe with the joints properly lined up.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>Edited on December 4, 2016, (Previously Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/michael-castro-do-editor/">Michael Castro, DO</a></strong></em>)</p><br />

The vast majority of clubfoot deformities are congenital in nature, and therefore acquired during development in the uterus and not through heredity. It occurs in approximately 1 in 1000 births and is bilateral about 50% of the time. A small percentage are related to a genetic or chromosomal abnormality and these deformities tend to be stiffer and more resistance to standard treatment.<br /><h2>Standard Treatment of Congenital Clubfoot</h2><br />The Ponseti method has become the standard treatment in the past decade. This treatment involves gently manipulating and then casting the foot on a weekly basis over a 4-6 week period. The child is then splinted 23 hours a day in a Foot Abduction Brace for a number of weeks after the casting, and then when the child sleeps or naps for up to 4 years. About 80% of children will need to have the Achilles tendon lengthened via a small incision at the back of the heel. A small percentage will require other tendon procedures, but major foot surgery which was the norm 20 years ago is no longer required. This technique was developed by <em><strong><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/24/health/research/24ponseti.html">Dr. Ignacio Ponseti</a></strong></em> (1914-2009) in the 1940s, but only became popularized in the 1990s after stories of its success relative to the standard surgical treatment spread over the internet.<br /><h2>Later Consequences of Clubfoot</h2><br />Untreated clubfoot deformities continues to be a problem in the developing world.  In severe cases adults, individuals will walk on what should be the top of their feet, creating a debilitating limp. Clubfoot deformities that were treated aggressively in the past can also cause symptoms in adults.Persistent deformity resulting in uneven loading of the foot to the outside and ankle and hindfoot arthritis is common. The ankle bone, or talus, is often flattened  (flat top talus).Even a well treated congenital clubfoot is likely to have some residual foot issues, which may include a smaller foot that tends to load more on the outside. This can lead to <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/jones-fracture-5th-metatarsal-stress-fracture">5th MT stress fractures</a></strong></em>, <em><strong><a href="/peroneal-tendonitis">peroneal tendonitis</a></strong></em>, and arthritis.<br /><p>Edited January 11, 2017</p><br /><p></p>
Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://lance">Lance Silverman, MD</a></strong></em><br /><h2>Summary</h2><br /><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/01-11-2014-Dancers-Fracture-Handout.pdf">Dancers Fracture </a></strong></em><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/01-11-2014-Dancers-Fracture-Handout.pdf">(5th Metatarsal Avulsion Fracture) Handout</a></strong></em>A twisting injury to the ankle and foot may cause an avulsion (pulling off) fracture of the base of the 5th metatarsal - the bone that attaches the little toe to the midfoot (Figure 1). During an avulsion injury, a small fragment of bone at the base of the 5th metatarsal is pulled off by a strong ligament that is attached to this part of the bone. A Dancer's fracture causes localized pain, swelling, and difficulty walking. In most instances, this type of fracture can be treated non-operatively, with relative immobilization in a walking boot combined with limited weight-bearing. It typically takes about 6 weeks for adequate bone healing to occur, before patients can start to significantly increase their activity level. It often takes 12 or more weeks for a full recovery to occur. This type of injury needs to be differentiated from a &quot;<em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/jones-fracture-5th-metatarsal-stress-fracture">Jones fracture</a></strong></em>&quot;, which occurs slightly further towards the center of the 5th metatarsal.<br /><h5>Figure 1:  Dancer's Fracture</h5><br />^media_display_589c2972de9125bcb769306e/position:center^<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />A patient who suffers an acute rolling of their ankle can also injure the base of the 5th metatarsal (See Figure 1). This will produce immediate pain over the outside aspect of the foot. It can be associated with significant swelling. Over time, the skin can turn black and blue. It will be associated with quite specific local tenderness over the base of the bone, on the outside of the foot (the 5th metatarsal). Patients who have suffered a 5th metatarsal base avulsion fracture will give a history of a twisting injury to their ankle and foot (inversion plantarflexion injury), similar to what occurs with an <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/sprained-ankle">ankle or foot sprain</a></strong></em> (Figure 2).<br /><h5>Figure 2: Twisting mechanism causing injury</h5><br />^media_display_589c2973de9125bcb7693071/position:center^<br /><h2>Physical Examination</h2><br />When pressing on the outside of the foot, there will be marked tenderness at the base of 5th metatarsal. There may be tenderness over a large area of the outside the foot. However, the main tenderness will be at the base of the 5th metatarsal. On exam, it is determined if the patient can still move their foot to the outside (eversion of the foot). This is done by placing the foot in an everted position and asking them to maintain that position against some resistance. This assesses for continuity of the tendons that evert the foot. Doing this usually creates some discomfort for the patient. However, they usually are able to perform the action.<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />X-ray of the foot will reveal an avulsion (&quot;pulling off&quot;) fracture of the base of the 5th metatarsal. The size of the fractured fragment may vary considerably. There will be more gapping at the fracture site, plantarly (on the bottom of the foot) and on the outside of the bone (lateral side), compared to the inside of the bone (medial side - Figures 3A and 3B).<br /><h5>Figure 3A: X-ray from the side (Lateral view)</h5><br />^media_display_589c2974de9125bcb7693074/position:center^<br /><h5>Figure 3B: X-ray from the top (AP View)</h5><br />^media_display_589c2975de9125bcb7693077/position:center^<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br />A Dancer's fracture is an injury that is usually treated non-operatively. If the patient has the ability to actively move the foot outwards (eversion), the injury will likely heal with non-operative treatment. Treatment involves relative rest and time to allow the fracture to heal. Typically, patients are placed in a walking boot. For the first few weeks, they will have to significantly limit their walking and should be given crutches. As the swelling settles and the fracture starts to heal, they can begin walking more extensively in the boot. Usually by 6 weeks, there is enough healing to allow them to transition to a stiff-soled shoe with lots of padding.This is a frustrating injury because it takes a long time for healing to occur. Patients are often still symptomatic 8weeks or more after this injury. It can be many months before the bone is completely healed and a full recovery has been achieved. When there is complete displacement of the fracture fragments and union is unlikely, surgery is indicated. In other circumstances, when a person's employment or recreation require a rreliable and routine return by 4-6 weeks, surgery is also indicated. In these cases, the bone fragments are repositioned and stabilized with a screw and weight bearing is started immediately.It is important not to overlook other associated injuries to ligaments of the ankle and foot. Ankle or foot instability, when present should be addressed to avoid recurrence of ankle inversion injuries.A Dancer's fracture is often confused with a 5th metatarsal metadiaphyseal stress fracture (Jones fracture). A <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/jones-fracture-5th-metatarsal-stress-fracture">Jones fracture</a></strong></em> can occur as a result of a stress fracture or acute trauma.  Unlike a Dancer's fracture, a <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/jones-fracture-5th-metatarsal-stress-fracture">Jones fracture</a></strong></em> will more commonly fail to heal without surgery despite extended periouds of non weight bearing.<br /><h3><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/01-11-2014-Dancers-Fracture-Handout.pdf">Click Here</a> for a Summary Handout about Dancer's Fractures</h3><br /><p>Edited December 11, 2016</p>
Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/judith-smith-md/">Judith Smith, MD </a></strong></em><br /><h2>Summary</h2><br />Diabetes is a medical condition characterized by elevated blood sugar. Having diabetes has a number of important implications for foot and ankle problems. Diabetes occurs either because the pancreas does not produce enough insulin [type 1 diabetes]. In this situation, insulin is what helps to lower the blood sugar. The second and more common situation is when the cells of the body do not respond to insulin, even though the insulin levels are normal. Because of this, the blood sugar level is not controlled, [type 2 diabetes].With elevated levels of blood sugar over time, the tissues will often become stiff as they get saturated with the sugar. Tissues that get affected include muscles and tendons, as well as nerves leading to nerve dysfunction and abnormal sensation. In addition, blood vessels can be damaged, leading to decreased blood flow, particularly to the small arteries.<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />There are two main problems related to diabetes in the foot. The first is decreased circulation, which tends to occur in patients with longstanding diabetes, especially if it is poorly controlled. The second problem is decreased sensation to the foot. A loss of protective sensation is often the most the important problem that diabetes creates. Altered sensation to the foot means that the individual cannot feel normal pressure and pain. For example, if a diabetic patient loses the ability to feel the pressure of a specialized bristle pushed against the foot until it bends (a 10-gm force), this represents the loss of over 97 percent of their normal sensation. This loss of sensation can lead to repetitive  such as <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/diabetic-ulcer">diabetic ulcerations</a> or stress fractures [<a href="http://www.footeducation.com/diabetic-charcot-arthropathy">Charcot arthropathy</a>] as patients are unable to sense that their tissue is being injured.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br />Treatment of diabetes is very important. It is critical that patients maintain an appropriate blood sugar level. An appropriate treatment regimen should be developed in close consultation with the patient's primary care physician. Treatment of type 2 diabetes might simply involve keeping a careful track of the patient's diet so as to avoid excessive simple sugars and carbohydrates. It is important for a patient with diabetes to carefully monitor their blood sugar levels and keep these levels below 100. A regular measurement of a patients hemoglobin A1C (HgA1C) provides excellent feedback to patients to help them determine how well their diabetes is being controlled. If a patient’s diabetes is poorly controlled there will be too much glucose in the blood stream. A certain amount of this will become attached to the hemoglobin in the red blood cells leading to increased levels of HgA1C. In a non-diabetic patient HgA1C levels are normally below 6 percent. Ideally a diabetic patient should strive to keep their HgA1C levels below 6 percent as well. Foot surgery on diabetic patients with a HgA1C greater than 7 have been shown to be associated with higher complications such as <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications">post operative infection</a> and <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems">wound healing issues</a>. With HgA1C greater than 9 these risks become prohibitive.If simple diet modifications are not enough, there are oral medications [oral hypoglycemics].If diet and oral medication is not enough to control the type 2 diabetes, then insulin may be required.Treatment of type 1 diabetes usually requires regular insulin injections or an insulin pump. Regardless of the type of the diabetes, it is critically important that patients work very closely with their primary care doctors, so as to maintain tight control of their blood sugar levels.<br /><p>Edited December 3, 2016 (Originally Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/timothy-charlton-md-editor" target="_blank">Timothy Charlton MD</a> </strong></em>)</p><br />       
Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/hussein-pazkad-md/">Hossein Pakzad, MD</a></strong></em><br /><h2>Summary</h2><br />Charcot Arthropathy is a destructive breakdown of the joints within the foot in patients with neuropathy or abnormal sensation. The most common cause of Charcot Arthropathy is <strong><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/diabetes/">diabetes</a></em></strong>.  The condition is named after Jean Marie Charcot (1825-1893), who described the collapse of the bones of the foot in patients who had lost feeling in the feet from advanced syphilis. Due to neuropathy or abnormal sensation, pain usually is not the early symptoms, instead swelling and redness are the main reasons patients seek medical attention. Treatment is initially non-surgical and involves minimizing weight-bearing through the foot, by using a total contact cast or walker boot until the bones in the foot become more stable.  This often takes 6-12 months or more.  The goal of treatment is to create a stable foot, without deformity to avoid abnormal pressure point which may result to <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/diabetic-ulcer">diabetic ulcer</a></strong></em>.  Surgery is essentially reserved for unstable and deformed feet that cannot resume function. Surgery on patients with Charcot foot deformities is often associated with a high complication rate.<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />The involved foot is usually swollen, red, and warm and can easily be confused with infection.  Since patients with abnormal sensation or neuropathy don’t feel their feet very well, pain normally is not the early sign and in fact in early stage, swelling and redness are the main patient’s concerns. This condition can be painful, but is commonly not as painful as it would be if they had normal feeling. Some patients may have had a period of increased activity, leading to repetitive loading stress through their foot or ankle, or they may have had a mild injury. It is important to know that Charcot arthropathy can look similar to an infection and is commonly mistaken for this. Charcot<u> </u>arthropathy has three stages;<br /><ol><br /> 	<li><em>Acute phase;</em> when foot is swollen and red and warm and may last several weeks. In this stage, foot bone architecture starts self-destruction and reabsorbing itself.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Subacute phase;</em> when redness disappears and swelling is less. In this stage, destruction slows down and the body is trying to mend itself.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Chronic phase</em>; when redness and swelling are resolved. In this stage, foot bone architecture is recovering and restoring itself and become stronger. The three common involved locations in human foot include the tarsal-metatarsal [middleof the foot] joints, the transverse tarsal joint [hindpart of the foot just in front of the ankle], and the ankle joint.</li><br /></ol><br />Charcot arthropathy is a particularly frustrating and debilitating condition because it can take 6-12 months or more to resolve.  Furthermore, when it does get better, the foot may have collapsed and changed shape. The resulting deformity can put the patient at risk to develop an ulcer over new prominent bony areas.<br /><h2>Physical Examination</h2><br />Observation of the foot usually shows swelling and redness.  This redness will usually resolve or improve with elevation (above the heart).  This makes it different than a skin infection, which will often remain red when elevated.  It is important to look for breaks in the skin, as this may suggest infection instead of Charcot arthropathy.  Although the two can be present at the same time, it is usually one or the other.It is important to look for deformity.  The goal of treatment is to prevent deformity, so noticing early deformity is crucial to keep it from getting worse.  As this process usually happens in people with loss of feeling in the foot, examination will often demonstrate abnormal (but not completely absent) sensation.  However, Charcot arthropathy often happens before the patient has noticed any changes in the sensation of the feet.  Blood supply to the foot should also be assessed (as with any patient), although in Charcot, adequate blood supply is rarely the problem.It is also important to look at the other foot. Charcot arthropathy on one foot greatly increases that chance that the patient will develop a similar situation on the other foot. This can happen at the same time, but more commonly happens sometime after the other foot gets better.  Diabetic patients should always be checking their feet regularly for problems.<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />Regular x-rays are important.  If caught early, these x-rays may not show any abnormalities.  Sometimes they will show a decrease in bone density (osteopenia) or a break in the bones involved.   If the process has progressed, the x-ray may show deformity of the foot or ankle.CT scans can be helpful to look at a more detailed picture of the collapse, but this often unnecessary unless surgery is planned.Bone Scans can sometimes be helpful to sort out whether the problem is infection or Charcot arthropathy.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br /><em>Before attention is directed toward the treatment of Charcot foot, patients need to be reminded about the treatment of the underlying cause. <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/diabetes/"><strong>Diabetes</strong> </a>is the most common cause and treatment goal should be directed toward tight sugar control and aim for HbA1C between 6 and 8.</em><br /><h3>Non-Operative Treatment</h3><br />When detected early, treatment involves a period of non-weight bearing or limited weight-bearing in either a special cast, often called a total contact cast, or in a diabetic removable boot (often called a CAM boot or <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/cam-walker-walking-boot">walker boot</a></strong></em>).  Later in the process, when the bones have started to stabilize, the patient can walk more and put increasingly more weight on the leg.There are devices that are available, such as rolling <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/knee-walker">knee walkers</a> </strong></em>and scooter or roll about, which can help keep the weight off the bad foot while allowing patients to be mobile and not over-loading the better foot.There are some studies that suggest that the use of bisphosphonates (anti-osteoporosis medications) may be helpful in treating Charcot arthropathy by trying to limit the activity of the cells that eat away bone.<br /><h3>Operative Treatment</h3><br />If a severe deformity has occurred, or if the foot or ankle has become unstable, then surgery may be recommended.Surgery ranges from simple removal of prominent bone [exostectomy], to reconstruction of the foot with fusion of the bones after the deformity is corrected.  This can involve the use of screws and plates, or rods that go inside the bone, or pins that come out of the bone and skin and attach to a frame on the outside of the foot and ankle.The goal of surgery is to create a stable foot which can bear weight, and can fit in a shoe or brace and prevent ulcers developing over prominent areas of bone.  Most surgical procedures that involve fusion will typically require a long period of not putting any weight on the foot or leg for 3 months or more.<br /><h2>Potential Complications</h2><br />Surgery for Charcot arthropathy is associated with significant risks. These include increased risks of:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#infection">Infection</a>: </strong></em>Due to lack of blood circulation to the foot</li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems">Wound healing problems </a></strong></em>(which is commonly a problem with diabetic patients).</li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#non-union">Non-union</a></strong></em>:  There is an increased risk of bones not healing together because patients often don’t realize how much pressure they are putting on the foot during the healing process.  However, a failure of the bone to heal is not necessarily a failure of treatment.  If the goals listed above are met, then the surgery was a success.</li><br /></ul><br /><p align="right">Edited January 10, 2017</p><div></div>

It is not uncommon for people with <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/diabetes">diabetes </a></strong></em>who have developed forefoot ulcers, to ultimately end up with a partial or complete amputation of their foot and even the leg, as a result of the ulcer and spread of infection from the diabetic ulcer.Patients with longstanding diabetes, who have lost sensation or have diminished sensation in their foot, are at risk for developing a diabetic plantar ulceration on the bottom of their foot. Quite often, patients with diabetes do not appreciate that they have altered or diminished sensation in their foot. The altered sensation prevents them from sensing pain, such as they would normally experience with a blister on their foot or with shoes that do not fit appropriately. Therefore they end up with blistering and subsequent breakdown of skin and deeper tissues over a localized pressure area of the foot, and this can become an ulcer. Often, the area starts off as a callus, or if it occurs quickly, it may appear as a simple blister. However, when the blistered skin is removed, it will reveal a deep ulceration. Patients who lost the protective sensation are therefore at a greater risk of developing an ulcer especially if their feet also have deformities such as a <em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/bunions-hallux-valgus/"><strong>bunion</strong> </a></em>or <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/claw-toes/">hammer toes</a></strong></em>.<br /><h2>Physical Examination</h2><br />Physical examination focuses on the location of the diabetic ulcer as well as the depth. It is important to assess whether or not the ulcer extends down to the bone or into the joint, which could lead to osteomyelitis (bone infection). A foul odor or redness spreading from the ulcer up the foot or the leg signifies serious infection. Typically, the ulcers will occur over a prominent area, often associated with the base of one or more toes, although ulcers in other areas can occur. They can occur over the top of a deformed toe or at its tip. At times these occur under the ball of the foot, again related to an area that is prominent and gets disproportionately overloaded such as in a foot with high arch. Essentially, any area of the foot that is subject to concentrated repetitive force is at risk for developing a diabetic ulceration. Risk factors for developing an ulcer include not only include prominent areas taking disproportionate amount of force but also stiff or tight muscles and joints such as a tight calf muscle (<em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/equinus-contractures">equinus contracture</a></strong></em>) which serves to increase the lever force of the foot, driving the forefoot into the ground with more force. An assessment of the patient’s sensation and circulation is also important. It is also important on physical exam to assess the patient’s opposite foot, as it may have problems that have not yet been diagnosed. Inspecting shoes for worn areas or foreign objects such as small stones or nails is also important. A thickened and overgrown toenail often due to <em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/toenail-fungal-infection-toenail-fungus-or-onychomycosis/"><strong>fungal infections</strong> </a></em>can also lead to increased pressure due to crowding in the toe box and an ulcer.<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />Radiographs will usually be taken to assess whether there is any obvious bone or joint involvement. Sometimes, an MRI can be useful to determine hidden deep soft tissue infection along tendons or muscle spaces, or reveal infection in the bone.  Occasionally, a bone scan is indicated, although very often the results of the bone scan will not change the management, and may not reveal any information that cannot be obtained from a detailed physical examination.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br />Treatment is designed to allow the ulceration to resolve. Essentially, this involves removing the pressure that caused the ulcer in the first place and thus off-loading the area of ulceration. This is typically done with a total contact cast or footwear modification that removes the offending pressure. It may be possible to fit the patient with a removable diabetic walker boot. In each instance, the goals are to offload the affected area and allow the tissues to heal. If this is done, it will often allow the ulceration to heal within 6-8 weeks for a full-blown ulceration.The patients that are at risk for ulcerations, but have not yet developed an ulcer, may be treated with inserts that are designed to disperse the force away from the affected area. The lining of these inserts are typically made of a soft material called plastizote. It takes on the shape of the foot and helps to spread the force away from the ulcerated area.Patient education is a very important component of managing diabetic ulcerations and patients with neuropathy. Ideally, ulcerations should be treated with prevention. Patients with diabetes, and particularly those who had altered sensation in their feet should:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em>Always wear appropriate footwear</em>. Shoes should not be too tight. They should not have any pressure points and they should have a good insert that helps disperse the force of walking throughout the sole of the foot. The upper should have a stretchy material such as a soft leather or fabric.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Check the soles <em>of their feet daily to look for any potential areas of skin breakdown or new blister formation. Check the insoles of the footwear regularly. Wear white seamless socks, which avoid pressures due to the seam and show up any discharge such as blood from a blister easily on the white color.</em> </em></li><br /> 	<li><em>Always wear shoes.</em> Shoes will allow them to avoid walking on hot surfaces. Walking bare feet on a hot surface that is not recognized because of their altered sensation is another way patients will have breakdown in the skin over the sole of their feet.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Keep their toenails well trimmed.</em> This typically involves keeping the toes trimmed, either straight across or with a gentle contour in the shape of the toe, and ensuring that the inside and outside edges of the toenails do not catch and jab into the associated skin.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Have regular foot checkups</em></li><br /></ul><br />Treatment of the ulceration may also involve trimming (debridement) of the callus or necrotic tissue. This can sometimes be done in clinic but not if there is infection or any bone involvement; in that case debridement in an operating room is usually necessary. In addition, it is increasingly common to perform a <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/gastrocnemius-slide-strayer-procedure">calf lengthening</a></strong></em> or Achilles tendon lengthening to help decrease the pressure, especially if the ulcer is on the bottom of the arch (midfoot) or ball (forefoot) of the foot. This can be highly successful, although it does need to be done with caution to prevent over lengthening. This is done as a formal operative procedure.Patients with diabetes and altered sensation of their feet who notice a breakdown in the skin should see a physician immediately. This is an urgent situation. The physician may want to prescribe antibiotics or they may consider simply off loading this area for a short period of time, allowing the area of skin breakdown to heal. Small areas of breakdown in the skin can become major limb threatening problems in a matter of days, if they are not carefully attended to.<br /><h5>Figure 1: This patient is likely to get an ulcer at the tips of the right second and third toes</h5><br /><h5>^media_display_589c2975de9125bcb769307d/position:center^</h5><br /><h5>Figure 2: This patient is overloading the forefoot and has calluses, blood blistering, and ulceration</h5><br /><h5>^media_display_589c2977de9125bcb7693080/position:center^</h5><br /><p>Edited on December 11, 2016 (Previously edited by <strong><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/vinod-k-panchbhavi-md-editor/">Vinod K.

Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/mark-perry-md/">Mark Perry, MD</a></strong></em><br /><h2>Summary</h2><br />Foot drop is the inability to bend the ankle ‘up” to avoid tripping when walking. It is caused by weakness or poor function of the muscles in the front of the leg (anterior compartment muscles). It is caused by direct injury to the muscle/tendon or nerve to those same muscles. Without treatment, patients with a drop foot will walk with a “high steppage gait” (similar to the way a horse walks) or tripping. Most people with foot drop can be treated to return to a functional gait, although it is uncommon that the ankle can ever return to “perfectly normal”<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br />Treatment of a foot drop initially depends on the underlying cause. In the case of significant loss of muscle function from a compartment syndrome, the muscle will usually not recover. However, if the foot drop is cause by an injury to the nerve supplying the anterior lower leg muscle compartment (the peroneal nerve), there is a chance that the nerve will recover (if it has only been &quot;stunned&quot; rather than cut or injured beyond repair). Treatment of a foot drop may include:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><strong><em>Daily <a href="/calf-stretch">calf stretching</a> to maintain ankle motion </em></strong>There is a tendency for the calf muscle to steadily pull the ankle into an equinus position (pointing down). However, a regular program of daily calf stretching will prevent this. The stretch can be done seated or standing as long as the “knee goes over the toe”. For this reason, daily calf stretching in an attempt to maintain ankle dorsiflexion is often recommended as a part of the treatment plan for patients who have a drop foot. Range of Motion must be restored before any other treatment can be effective.</li><br /></ul><br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-foot-orthosis-afo">Ankle Foot Orthoses (AFO) bracing</a> </strong></em>AFO bracing is the most common and simplest method to treat a foot drop. This brace keeps the ankle up in a neutral position, essentially partially replacing the function of the lost anterior muscle compartments. It is thin enough to fit into a shoe, and some types can “spring” the ankle up when the foot is not on the ground. An AFO also serves to keep the ankle under relatively constant stretch, and thereby may minimize the potential for the ankle to fall into an equinus position. Patients with a foot drop will often be able to walk with a much more normal gait pattern when they are wearing an AFO.  In cases in which the nerve or muscle damage is temporary, the AFO brace can possibly be reduced or eliminated once sufficient muscle function returns.  However, in some cases the brace will be needed permanently unless muscle tendon transfer surgery is performed and sometimes even then.</li><br /></ul><br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/posterior-tibial-tendon-transfer-to-dorsal-foot">Posterior Tibial Tendon Transfer to the Dorsal Midfoot</a> </strong></em>Patients with a permanent foot drop may benefit from a tendon transfer procedure designed to allow active lifting upwards of the ankle joint (dorsiflexion of the ankle) by taking a working muscle and redirecting it to work in place of the weak or non-working muscle. The most common procedure is to transfer the posterior tibial tendon (assuming this muscle is functioning normally) through the space between the tibia and the fibula bones (interosseous membrane) to the top of the foot. When this tendon transfer has healed and adequate rehabilitation and retraining of the muscle has occurred, this procedure can serve to splint to ankle in an improved position and provide some (but not necessarily normal) active muscle function to dorsiflex the ankle.</li><br /></ul><br /> <br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em><strong>Peroneal Nerve Release, Repair or Graft </strong></em>A release can be performed if there is a constriction(choking) of the nerve is caused ny tight fibers of scar. The constriction prevents the muscles from receiving the the signal to dorsiflex the foot. Releasing the scar (after total knee replacement or knee fractures) can allow the nerve to work normally, although this can take a long time. In some instances when the cause of the foot drop is an injury to the peroneal nerve (usually at the level of the knee), a direct nerve repair or nerve grafting may be indicated. This type of surgery needs to be performed by a surgeon with expertise in microsurgical nerve repairs. It is designed to provide a path for the nerve to “grow back”. This type of procedure may lead to some return of muscle function over time (the nerve generally grows back at a rate of about 0.5-1mm/day and often it needs to “grow” 100-150mm in total). However, unfortunately this type of repair rarely leads to a return of near normal muscle function and therefore this type of treatment often needs to be combined with <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-foot-orthosis-afo">AFO bracing</a></strong></em> and/or tendon transfers. The nerve injury/involvement can also be at the level of the hip (hip fractures or replacement) or in the spine. Often the nerve at these locations are “stunned” and respond to stretching and temporary AFO use.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>Edited on January 10, 2017 (Originally edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/anthony-van-bergeyk-md-editor" target="_blank">Anthony Van Bergeyk, MD</a></strong></em>)</p><br />

Usually this deformity does not create symptoms, although some children may complain of an ache in their arch or their calf muscles with increased activity. In most instances, the flatfoot deformity is flexible and is due to a tight outer calf muscle. Treatment of flexible feet is almost always non-surgical and includes calf stretching, activity modification, and comfortable shoes often consisting of a slight heel.<br /><h5>Figure 1A: Flexible Flatfoot - Front View</h5><br />^media_display_589c2978de9125bcb7693085/position:center^<br /><h5>Figure 1B: Flexible Flatfoot - Side View</h5><br />^media_display_589c297ade9125bcb7693088/position:center^<br /><h5>Figure 1C Flexible Flatfoot - Back View</h5><br />^media_display_589c297bde9125bcb769308b/position:center^<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />Many children have flat feet. In fact, flat feet are normal during development. However, some children develop marked flatfeet (often as adolescents) that are characterized by a striking flattening of the arch and a splaying outwards of the feet. Most of these individuals have no symptoms, or may have some general aching in their arches if they are particularly active. However, the extent of their deformity often causes parents to be quite alarmed and seek a consultation with an orthopaedic surgeon. It is important from a treatment perspective to know the type of flatfoot – either flexible or rigid.  Flexible flatfeet are much more common than rigid flatfeet. Flexible flatfeet are usually caused by a <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/equinus-contractures">tight calf muscle</a></strong></em>. Rigid flatfeet are usually caused by a <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/tarsal-coalition">tarsal coalition</a></strong></em> (failure of two or more bones of the hindfoot to separate).<br /><p align="left">Having flat feet is common, representing 20-30 percent of the population. Flatfoot deformities often run in families. Most individuals with flat feet have no symptoms.</p><h2>Physical Examination</h2><br />Children with flatfeet will have noticeable flattening of the arch on the inside of the foot. Often the foot will also be splayed outwardly (abducted). Walking will often be normal, though a limp may be noted if there is pain. Sensation to the foot will typically be normal. The physician will then try to determine whether the patient's flatfeet are flexible (good hindfoot motion) or rigid (limited hindfoot motion). The motion of the hindfoot - specifically whether the foot can be moved inward (inversion) or outward (eversion) will determine whether the flatfoot deformity is flexible or rigid. A “jack test” can also be used to differentiate between flexible and rigid deformities. During a “jack test,” the examiner holds the heel steady and bends the big toe upwards. If an arch forms, the flatfoot is deemed ‘flexible.’ If the foot remains flat, it is rigid.Patients with a flexible flatfoot deformity will have a <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/equinus-contractures">very tight outer calf muscle </a></strong></em>(gastrocnemius). As the foot is brought up with the knee straight, the foot will often be 20-30 degrees short of neutral (right angle to the lower leg) when the calf tightness prevents further ankle motion. In order to get the foot flat on the ground, this extra motion needs to come through the joint in front of the ankle (transverse tarsal joint made up of the calcaneocuboid and talonavicular joint). This does allow for extra upward motion of the foot, but the direction of this joint is such that the foot also splays out to the side, creating the flatfoot deformity. If the foot is examined with the knee bent, the ankle motion is usually much better as bending the knee joint takes the pressure off the outer calf muscle (the gastrocnemius). Having a <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/flexible-flatfeet">flexible flatfoot deformity</a></strong></em> tends to concentrate increased load through the inside of the ankle and the Achilles tendon, so it is not uncommon for children to have some symptoms in these areas, especially if they have periods of increased activity.<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />Plain weight bearing x-rays of the foot will demonstrate a flattened arch. In patients with a tarsal coalition, the coalition can often be seen on plain x-rays. However, it may be necessary to order a CT scan to fully assess whether a tarsal coalition is present. In some patients with vague symptoms, an MRI may help identify areas of bone edema (increased blood flow) or other potential sources of pain.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br />Flexible flatfeet are almost always treated non-operatively. Treatment may include:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/activity-modification"><em>Activity modification</em></a></strong>: Sometimes a short (1-2 week) period of limited activities can be enough to allow symptoms to settle. Less repetitive loading through tendons and joints will have the effect of decreasing irritation to these areas. In addition, a switch to activities that require less loading (ex. from running to cycling) may also help symptoms to settle.</li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/calf-stretch"><em>Calf stretching</em></a></strong>: Calf stretching is an important component of treating flexible flatfeet. It can be very helpful to try and stretch out the tight outer calf muscle, by turning the foot inward and stretching the calf with the knee straight. This should be performed on a daily basis for the best long-term effect</li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/comfort-shoes"><em>Comfort shoes with a slight heel</em></a></strong>: Wearing shoes with a slight heel can be helpful. Comfort shoes can help to disperse the force up the leg more smoothly, while a slight heel can have the effect of decreasing the amount of flattening of the arch that is required to get the foot flat on the ground.</li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/pre-fabricated-over-the-counter-orthotics-insert"><em>Shoe inserts</em></a></strong>: It seems intuitive that individuals with a flatfoot would benefit from an orthotic that helps &quot;prop up&quot; their arch. In fact a stiff orthotic designed to elevate the arch may be uncomfortable, as a marked amount of force would be required to fundamentally arch of the foot. However, a soft (accommodative) orthotic that can support the arch can be helpful. These orthotic inserts can often be obtained at sports stores or outdoor stores.</li><br /></ul><br /><h3>Operative Treatment</h3><br />Flexible flatfeet <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">rarely</span></em> require surgical intervention. When non-surgical treatment fails and the patients report pain, there are several options for treatment:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/gastrocnemius-slide-strayer-procedure"><i>Gastrocnemius recession</i></a></strong> involves lengthening the tight portion of the Achilles tendon. This treatment addresses what doctors believe to be the most common cause of flatfeet. While the goal of this surgical procedure is relief of pain, sometimes an arch will reform.</li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/lateral-column-lengthening"><i>Lateral column lengthening</i></a></strong> is a procedure in which the flatfoot is surgically corrected. An osteotomy (cut in bone) is performed in the calcaneus, and a specially cut wedge of bone is placed. This lengthening creates an arch to the bottom of the foot. It is usually done in conjunction with a gastrocnemius recession.</li><br /> 	<li><i>Subtalar Arthroresis</i> is a controversial procedure as there are some staunch advocates and some harsh critics. It involves placement of a device in the subtalar joint to “kick” the heel bone over and create an arch.  While removal of the implant is often required, once the soft tissues have healed the deformity usually remains corrected.</li><br /></ul><br />Treatment of a rigid flat foot is detailed within the section on <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/tarsal-coalition">Tarsal Coalitions</a></strong></em>.<br /><p>Edited on December 28, 2016 (Originally edited by <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/lance-silverman-md-editor" target="_blank"><strong><em>Lance Silverman, MD</em></strong></a>)</p><div></div><br />

They typically occur when there is a weakness in the lining of a joint or tendon that allows synovial fluid (fluid from the joint or tendon) to extravasate out, forming an outpouching. This leads to a smooth mass in the foot, usually in the midfoot or near the ankle. This mass can create discomfort and irritation with shoe wear. The mass will often fluctuate in size over time, intermittently getting larger and smaller.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br /><h3>Non-Operative Treatment</h3><br />Often Ganglion cysts can be treated symptomatically, by ensuring that there is adequate padding over the area of the cyst or space provided in the shoes.The cysts can be aspirated with a needle under sterile conditions, although the mass regularly returns over time as the underlying reason why it occurred (a rent in the joint or tendon lining) was not addressed.<br /><h3>Surgical Treatment</h3><br />Surgical resection of the ganglion cyst can be successful provided the origin of the cyst is removed.<br /><h2>Potential Complications</h2><br />Surgical resection of ganglion cysts may be associated with a surprisingly high rate of wound complications, as there is a tendency for synovial fluid to continue to drain from the wound.

Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/michael-salamon-md-editor">Michael Salamon, MD</a></strong></em><br /><h2>Summary</h2><br /><p class="summary">Gout is a painful arthritic condition that can affect any joint, but commonly involves the joint at the base of the great toe (See Figure 1). Gout occurs when uric acid (normally present in the blood) crystallizes in the lining of the involved joint. These urate crystals cause an intense inflammatory reaction that often creates marked pain and swelling. Risk factors for gout include elevated blood uric acid levels, combined with an increased acidity in the bloodstream. Initial treatment is aimed at decreasing symptoms and may include the use of anti-inflammatory medications, rest, and ice. Long-term management is oriented towards preventing recurrent attacks and limiting the long-term effects that gout may have on the involved joint.</p><h5>Figure 1: &quot;The Gout&quot; by James Gilray 1799</h5><br />^media_display_589c297cde9125bcb7693090/position:center^<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />Patients often report a relatively sudden onset of severe symptoms including pain, swelling, and redness. Gout may involve almost any joint in the body, but in about 75% of first attacks it affects the joint at the base of the big toe (Podagra), and less commonly it affects the ankle. Acute episodes of gout are usually associated with elevated blood levels of uric acid and increased acidity of the bloodstream, and therefore the following have been known to increase the risk of gout attacks in susceptible individuals:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em>Elevated blood uric acid levels</em>. Approximately 10-20% of people with high blood uric acid levels will eventually have a gout attack</li><br /> 	<li>A <em>prior history of gout</em> is perhaps the biggest risk factor for future attacks</li><br /> 	<li><em>Intake of foods high in protein (increased intake of purines)</em>. These foods include:  red meat, fatty fish (tuna, salmon, mackerel, herring, and sardines), and seafood (shrimps, prawns, scallops, and lobster)</li><br /> 	<li><em>Alcohol </em>intake may precipitate a gout attack</li><br /> 	<li><em>Kidney problems </em>may increase the risk of an attack of gout because about 70% of the uric acid in the blood is eventually excreted through the kidneys. So if the kidneys are not working optimally, the uric acid level in the blood will tend to rise</li><br /> 	<li><em>Obesity</em></li><br /> 	<li><em>Diabetes </em>(elevated blood sugar)</li><br /></ul><br />The diagnosis of gout is initially based on the patient's symptoms. An initial treatment can be started based on the patient's symptoms. Elevated blood uric acid levels will further support the diagnosis. The diagnosis of gout is confirmed by removing fluid from the affected joint (&quot;tapping&quot; or &quot;aspirating&quot; the joint) and looking at it under the microscope. Elongated rods of uric acid crystals will be seen when viewed under the microscope with polarized light.<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />X-rays are likely to be normal, except after multiple attacks or if there are other problems in the joint, such as <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/hallux-rigidus-hallux-limitus">hallux rigidus</a></strong></em> in the great toe. In patients who have suffered from gout over a long period of time, crystal collections (called &quot;tophi&quot;) may reach a size where they can be seen on x-rays. X-rays can be helpful to rule out other conditions that may cause similar symptoms, such as fractures, severe osteoarthritis, charcot athropathy, infection, or pseudogout. MRI is usually not indicated in making the diagnosis of gout.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br />The initial treatment of a gout attack is aimed at reducing the pain, which can be quite severe. After the initial symptoms have been resolved, long-term management of gout focuses on minimizing the risk of future attacks of gout.<br /><h4>Initial Treatment</h4><br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em>Anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs)</em>: NSAIDs are the primary treatment of an acute attack of gout. NSAIDs help blunt the intense inflammatory response the urate crystals created in the joint lining. Anti-inflammatory medications can start decreasing symptoms within a few hours. Patients may experience stomach discomfort and, in many instances, anti-inflammatory medications should be combined with a medication that helps &quot;protect&quot; the stomach. In patients that have had serious stomach problems, such as ulcers or bleeding, NSAIDs should not be given and another treatment option should be considered.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Oral corticosteroid medications</em>: Oral steroids, such as Prednisone, can also help decrease the inflammation in the involved joint. These can be quite effective, but have potentially serious side effects.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Colchicine</em>: This medication can be effective if taken within 12 hours of the attack. However, it is associated with potential stomach problems (diarrhea and nausea).</li><br /> 	<li><em>Steroid injection in the joint</em>: Injecting steroids directly in the joint may have some benefit. In addition, removing fluid at the time of the injection may allow the diagnosis of gout to be confirmed. However, the injections themselves can be painful and there is always a small chance that infection will be introduced into the joint.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Ice</em>: Ice applied to the joint for 10-15 minutes at a time may help improve the acute pain associated with a gout attack. It is unclear if applying heat to the involved area is a good idea. Applying heat will increase the blood flow to the area and may aggravate symptoms. However, it has been suggested that increasing the temperature to the area may decrease the formation of crystals in the joint.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Elevating the involved joint</em>: Elevating the involved extremity 10â€-18â€ above the level of your heart (ex. propping your foot up on a pillow if the big toe or ankle is affected) may help symptoms by helping to decrease the swelling.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Drinking lots of water</em>: It is thought that drinking lots of fluid will help dilute the uric acid crystals and thereby decrease the chance of more crystals forming in the joint. In addition, increase fluid intake may encourage the excretion of uric acid in the urine.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Hemorrhoid Creams</em>: It has been suggested that hemorrhoid cream applied directly to the involved joint may help decrease the skin swelling that is often present with an acute gout attack.</li><br /></ul><br /><h4>Long Term Management of Gout</h4><br />A variety of treatment approaches have been recommended to minimize the risk of recurrent gout attacks including:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em>Allopurinol</em>: This medication decreases uric acid level in the blood stream (by inhibiting Xanthine Oxidase). It is commonly used and generally safe. However, it should NEVER be taken with Azathiorine (Imuran) as a potentially fatal reaction can occur.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Low Fat, Low Protein Diet</em>: Purines are commonly found in beef and seafood. Breakdown of purine leads to uric acid. Therefore, decreasing the intake of purines will tend to decrease uric acid levels in the blood and ultimately minimize the risk of future gout attacks.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Avoid high sugar soft-drinks</em>: Many soft-drinks will increase blood uric acid levels, and therefore limiting the intake of soft-drinks may be an important part of the long-term management of gout.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Surgical Resection of Gouty Tophi</em>:  Occasionally, the collection of uric acid will form lumps (gouty tophi) in the lining of the involved joints.  In rare instances, these lumps can become large enough that they will need to be removed surgically.</li><br /></ul><br /><p align="right">Edited  on November 22, 2016</p><h2></h2><br /><p></p>

The loss of joint cartilage, which occurs first along the top half of this joint, is believed to result from changes in joint dynamics that lead to increased pressure across the joint as the toe bends upward. This can take many years to develop, but can become quite symptomatic. In the later stages of this disease process, cartilage covering the remainder of the joint surface also erodes, leading to a progressively worse and more bothersome arthritic joint.<br /><h5>Figure 1A:  Hallux Rigidus Pain Location</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Hallux-Rigidus-Figure-11.jpg">^media_display_589c297dde9125bcb7693094/position:center^</a><br /><h5>Figure 1B:  Great Toe Joint Bone Spur</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Hallux-Rigidus-Figure-2.jpg">^media_display_589c297fde9125bcb7693097/position:center^</a><br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />Patients with hallux rigidus will typically present with pain, stiffness, and swelling in the great toe joint. This is aggravated by activities that involve excessive, repetitive upward movement of the big toe joint, such as prolonged walking. Swelling usually occurs along the top half of the joint, and will be frequently associated with bone spur formation, recognized as a “new prominence” by the patient (See Figure 1B).  As the condition progresses, patients often compensate by putting more weight on the outside of the foot as they walk.  This may cause pain in the forefoot (<a href="http://www.footeducation.com/metatarsalgia">metatarsalgia</a>)<i>.</i> Physical examination will reveal limited and often painful motion in the big toe joint, particularly when the patient is weightbearing. Prominent bone spurs [osteophytes] on the top part [dorsal aspect] of the joint are usually visible and palpable. It is very common to see these findings in both feet, although usually one foot is more symptomatic than the other.  Tenderness to touch is common over the swollen great toe joint.<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />Weightbearing foot x-rays will typically identify some loss of first MTP joint cartilage, seen as narrowing of this space on the x-ray – as compared to other similar spaces seen in nearby unaffected joints. There may be squaring of the metatarsal head on the anterior and posterior view. The lateral view will often show a prominent dorsal bone spur (See Figure 2).<br /><h5>Figure 2A and 2B: Weight bearing x-rays showing Hallux Rigidus</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Hallux-Rigidus-Figure-3.jpg">^media_display_589c2980de9125bcb769309a/position:center^</a>   <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Hallux-Rigidus-Figure-4.jpg">^media_display_589c2981de9125bcb769309d/position:center^</a><br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br /><h3>Non-Operative Treatment</h3><br />In most cases, hallux rigidus can be successfully treated non-operatively. The principle of nonoperative treatment is to decrease the inflammation in the arthritic joint by limiting the motion through this joint. Successful non-operative management often involves:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><i>Limiting great toe motion</i>. The pain associated with movement of this joint can be limited with the use of a stiff-soled shoe, with a slight rocker bottom contour. Alternatively, a rigid shank can be applied to the shoe, a foot plate may be inserted under the orthotic, or an orthotic with a Morton’s extension (a.k.a. “Turf Toe Plate”) can be used. Each of these serve to decrease or eliminate the painful motion of this great toe joint, when affected by hallux rigidus.</li><br /> 	<li><i>Use of a wide-toe box</i> made of soft material should also be used to allow more space for the great toe thereby limiting the irritation over the swollen toe.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Anti-inflammatory medication</em>. The use of an over the counter anti-inflammatory may also be helpful in improving symptoms.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Injection</em>. Short-term improvement of symptoms may alternatively be obtained with injection of a corticosteroid or hyaluronic acid, derivative into the first MTP joint. Unfortunately, these treatments will not lead to predictable, long-term improvement in the patient’s symptoms, and therefore have limited indications. They can, however, provide significant short-term relief – although they are not recommended for repetitive, long-term use, even if effective because of potentially cumulative side effects.</li><br /></ul><br /><h3>Operative Treatment</h3><br />When patients fail non-operative management, reasonable operative options are available and should be considered. There are three broad categories of operative treatment. These include:<br /><ol><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/great-toe-cheilectomy-bone-spur-removal">1st MTP joint dorsal cheilectomy</a></strong></em> (<em>Bone spur removal</em>).</li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/great-toe-fusion-1st-mtp-joint-fusion">Fusion of the first MTP joint</a>.</strong></em></li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/1st-metatarsal-phalangeal-mtp-joint-replacement-arthroplasty">First MTP joint arthroplasty</a></strong></em> [<em>first MTP joint replacement</em>].</li><br /></ol><br /><h3><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Hallux-Rigidus-Handout-FINAL-01-22-2009.pdf">Click Here</a> for a Summary Handout on Hallux Rigidus</h3><br /><p align="right">Edited on January 4, 2017</p>
Edited by <strong><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/daniel-guss-md-2/">Daniel Guss, MD, M.B.A.</a></em></strong><br /><h2>Summary: Bunions</h2><br />A bunion (a.k.a Hallux Valgus) is a common foot condition associated with a prominent bump on the inside of the forefoot (see Figure 1). The word bunion originates from the Latin root for the word &quot;turnip&quot;.  Bunions can lead to discomfort over the prominence, especially if patients wear tight fitting shoes. It is common for bunions to run in a family and gradually worsen over time. The vast majority of bunions can be managed successfully with basic non-operative treatment. Surgery is reserved for patients who have persistent symptoms in spite of appropriate non-operative treatment.<br /><h5>Figure 1 : Bunion Deformity</h5><br />^media_display_589c2983de9125bcb76930a1/position:center^<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation: Bunions</h2><br />Patients with bunions will often describe pain over the prominent bump on the inside of their forefoot (the medial eminence). They may also experience pain under the ball of the foot near the base of the second toe. Symptoms can vary in severity, from none at all to severe discomfort aggravated by standing and walking. There is no direct correlation between the size of the bunion and the patient's symptoms. Some patients with severe bunion deformities may have minimal symptoms, while patients with mild bunion deformities may have significant symptoms. Symptoms are often exacerbated by restrictive shoe wear, particularly shoes with a narrow toe box or an uncomfortable, stiff, toe box.Patients with bunions often have a positive family history. It is common for patients to have a first-degree relative who has had a bunion, flatfoot deformity, or significant clawing of their lesser toes. This may be the biggest risk factor for developing a significant bunion deformity.The primary anatomic cause of a bunion is that the bone on the inside of the forefoot at the base of the big toe (the first metatarsal) begins to drift and separate away from the bone of the midfoot at the base of second toe (the second metatarsals). This V-shaped separation pushes the great toe outwards creating a prominent bump known as a bunion deformity- on the inside of the foot. The bunion bump is often normal bone sticking out of the side of the foot, rather than a growth of new bone. Thickening of the tissues overlying the bony prominence can worsen the prominence. Over time, arthritis can also develop in the joint.Bunion deformities can vary greatly in their extent and in the symptoms that they cause. Most commonly the symptoms are worsened by restrictive shoe wear, specifically shoes with a narrow toe box or very stiff, non-pliable material that cannot stretch over the bump.<br /><h2>Physical Examination: Bunions</h2><br />Physical examination typically reveals a prominent bump on the inside of the forefoot. As the metatarsal, the midfoot bone, starts moving outwards, the big toe itself starts drifting inwards, combining to worsen this bump. Drifting of the big toe actually causes the big toe joint to &quot;subluxate&quot;, which means it moves out of place. In mild and moderate bunions, this joint may be repositioned back to a neutral position (reduced) on physical examination. With increased deformity or arthritic stiffness the big toe joint (the first MTP joint) cannot be fully straightened to a normal position. Patients may also have a skin callus at the base of their second toe in the sole of the forefoot because as the first toe drifts, the second toe carries more weight, and this can be an additional source of pain called <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/metatarsalgia/">metatarsalgia</a>.<br /><h2>Imaging Studies: Bunions</h2><br />If your surgeon is contemplating an operation, it is common to obtain weight-bearing x-rays of the foot. These x-rays are typically taken from the top (anteroposterior) (see Figure 2) and from the sides (lateral). Both of these x-ray views allow the operation of the big toe joint (first MTP joint) to be observed.<br /><h5>Figure 2 : X-ray showing bunion</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/bunion-figure-2.jpg">^media_display_589c2984de9125bcb76930a4/position:center^</a>The degree of big toe angulation can be measured on x-ray. Mild deformities are considered a big toe angulation of &lt;20 degrees, moderate deformities from 20-40 degrees and in severe deformities the great toe angulation is greater than 40 degrees. It is important that the x-rays be obtained in a full weight-bearing position in order to adequately assess the alignment issues associated with the bunion deformity.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br /><h3>Non-Operative Treatment: Bunions</h3><br />The initial treatment of a bunion should be non-operative. Symptoms can often be greatly improved with simple non-operative interventions. Non-operative treatment may include:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/non-operative-treatment/comfort-shoes/">Properly fitted shoes</a>: </em>Properly fitting comfort shoes with a wide non-constrictive toe box, especially one that is made out of a soft material such as leather, can be quite helpful in reducing the irritation over the prominent bunion. In some instances, it is helpful to have a shoemaker stretch the inside aspect of the shoe. Jamming a foot with a bunion into a constrictive shoe will likely lead to the development of uncomfortable symptoms.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Bunion pads (bunion sleeve): </em>Bunion pads may also be helpful in decreasing the symptoms associated with the bunion (Figure 3). These pads can be obtained at many drugstores. Essentially they serve to lessen the irritation over the medial prominence and, thereby, decrease the associated inflammation This should be combined with comfortable non-constrictive shoes.</li><br /> 	<li><em>A toe spacer</em> placed between the great toe and the second toe can help to straighten the bunion deformity and, thereby, decrease the irritation associated with the bunion. Toe spacers can be obtained at most drug stores or online.</li><br /> 	<li><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/foot-and-ankle-medical-supplies/pre-fabricated-over-the-counter-orthotics-insert/">Soft shoe inserts</a>:</em> Over-the-counter accommodative orthotics may also help bunion symptoms. This product is particularly helpful if bunion symptoms include pain that is under the ball of the foot. Orthotics with a slight arch may be helpful for patients that have flat feet. These can be purchased at many sports stores, outdoors stores, or pharmacies.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Bunion splints</em> have often been used to treat the symptoms associated with hallux valgus. These splints are typically worn at night in an effort to reduce the bunion deformity. There is no evidence to suggest that these splints decrease the rate at which bunion deformities occur. There is also no evidence that clearly supports their effectiveness. Some patients, however, report good relief with the use of these splints.</li><br /></ul><br /><h5>Figure 3: Bunion Sleeve -soft material pads the prominent bunion</h5><br />^media_display_589c2986de9125bcb76930a7/position:center^<br /><h3>Operative Treatment: Bunions</h3><br />Surgery should only be considered for bunions that are moderately to severely painful, and NOT for correction of the cosmetic appearance. The primary indication for operative intervention is pain that is not relieved by appropriate non-operative management. Although symptom-free bunions can slowly worsen or increase in size over time, surgical treatment is NOT recommended unless significant pain symptoms develop. The prolonged recovery time associated with most bunion operations, combined with the potential for complications means that patients should be thoughtful about considering bunion surgery.There are many different procedures that have been described to correct bunions. The type of operation your foot surgeon recommends to correct your bunion should be dictated by the severity of your bunion deformity and the surgeon's preference. There are well over 100 different bunion correction procedures described in the orthopaedic literature. However, the broad categories of bunion correction procedures are listed below, some of which link to a page where the surgery and recovery are described in detail.<br /><ol><br /> 	<li>Removal of the prominence on the inside of the foot (medial eminence).</li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/chevron-osteotomy-distal-for-hallux-vallgus-bunion">Distal metatarsal osteotomy</a></strong></em> (chevron) with great toe soft-tissue tightening (medial capsular tightening and distal soft-tissue repair).</li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/surgical-procedures/bunion-hallux-valgus-procedures-bunionectomy/proximal-metatarsal-osteotomy-for-bunion-hallux-valgus-correction/">Proximal metatarsal osteotomy</a></strong></em> Ludloff, Cresentic, SCARF, medial opening wedge) with with great toe soft-tissue tightening (medial capsular tightening and distal soft-tissue repair).</li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/lapidus-procedure-for-hallux-valgus-bunion-correction">Lapidus hallux valgus correction</a></strong></em> (first tarsometatarsal joint fusion) with distal soft tissue procedure.</li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/surgical-procedures/bunion-hallux-valgus-procedures-bunionectomy/great-toe-fusion-1st-mtp-joint-fusion/">Great Toe Fusion</a></strong></em> (1st MTP joint arthrodesis).</li><br /> 	<li>Akin osteotomy (Realignment bone cut at the base of the big toe)</li><br /> 	<li>Removal of the medial eminence with suture stabilization of the first and second metatarsals</li><br /> 	<li>Keller joint arthroplasty (removal of the proximal aspect of the proximal phalanx).</li><br /></ol><br /><h2>When to see an orthopaedic foot specialist</h2><br />For most people, sufficient education combined with following the above non-operative treatment measures will result in good function with fewer symptoms. Reasons to seek consultation with an orthopaedic foot specialist include:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li>Persistent bunion pain that does not improve with shoe modification and other non-operative measures.</li><br /> 	<li>Worsening bunion deformities that begin to involve the second toe, altering its alignment or causing additional pain.</li><br /></ul><br /><h3><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/HALLUX-VALGUS-Patient-Handout-Final-01-20-2009.pdf">Click Here</a> for a Summary Handout about Bunions</h3><br /><p>Edited November 17, 2016 (Previously edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/jean-brilhault-md-editor/">Jean Brilhault, MD</a>)</strong></em></p><h2 style="text-align: left;"></h2><br /><h2 style="text-align: left;">Read More: <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/2017/01/10/5-things-probably-didnt-know-bunions/">5 Things you probably didn't know about bunions!</a></h2><br /> 
Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/timothy-charlton-md-editor/">Timothy Charlton MD</a></strong></em><br /><h2>Summary</h2><br />A &quot;Jones' fracture&quot; is a special type of stress fracture of the base of the 5th metatarsal (Figure 1). The fracture itself often occurs acutely but the repetitive stress that leads up to the sudden fracture has often built up over time.  Jones fractures occur in a manner that is similar to the way that you would break a paper clip (by wiggling it back and forth over and over again). Therefore, activities that repetitively load the foot (for example sports with running) may lead to a Jones' fracture. These fractures tend to occur in people that have a <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/biomechanics-of-foot-and-ankle/foot-types/characteristics-of-high-arched-foot-subtle-cavus/">high arched foot shape</a>, or a leg shape that results in increased loading on the outside part of the foot. These fractures can be treated with a cast or a special boot. However, they may break again because the reason why they occurred (loading pattern of the foot) has not changed. Therefore, surgical treatment of Jones' fractures is common, and it sometimes involves re-aligning the foot to prevent the bone from breaking again in the future.<br /><h5>Figure 1:  Jones Fracture</h5><br />^media_display_589c2987de9125bcb76930ab/position:center^<br /><h5>Figure 2:  Location of Pain</h5><br />^media_display_589c2988de9125bcb76930ae/position:center^<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />Individuals who suffer a Jones' fracture will report pain on the outside of the midfoot (Figure 2). This pain can be quite sudden corresponding to when the fracture fully breaks through the bone.  Patients will have difficulty bearing weight and may walk with a limp. In most instances, the patient will describe exactly when the fracture occurred, often after landing heavily or performing some other demanding but routine activity. However, sometimes the main symptom will be a chronic (long-term) ache in the outside part of the foot - representing a developing stress fracture of the base of the fifth metatarsal.  Many patients will report a history of some pain in the foot, prior to the actual break. It is possible to have the problem in both feet, although usually one side hurts more.<br /><h2>Physical Examination</h2><br />Patients with a Jones' fracture will have pain at the fracture site (Figure 2). Often they will have high arched feet and/or an alignment of the lower extremity that tends to load the outside part of their feet (Figure 3). Sometimes, when looking at these patients’ shoes, one will see excessive wear of the outside of the sole because of the pressure put on that part of the foot and shoe.<br /><h5>Figure 3: High arched foot strike pattern often seen in Jones' Fracture patients</h5><br />^media_display_589c2989de9125bcb76930b1/position:center^<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />Plain x-rays will identify a Jones' fracture. The fracture itself occurs at the area where the more flexible bone at the base of the metatarsal, meets the more rigid bone of the shaft of the metatarsal. The fracture is different from a <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/dancers-fracture-5th-metatarsal-avulsion-fracture">Dancer's fracture</a></strong></em> which occurs when one of the ligaments pulls off (avulses) the tip of the 5th metatarsal base (Figure 4). Notice in Figure 4A that the fracture line is further down the 5th metatarsal than a Dancer Fracture (figure 4B).<br /><h5>Figure 4: Jones Fracture (4A Left) vs <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/dancers-fracture-5th-metatarsal-avulsion-fracture/">Dancer's Fracture</a> (4B Right)</h5><br />^media_display_589c298ade9125bcb76930b4/position:center^ ^media_display_589c298bde9125bcb76930b7/position:center^<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br />Like most fractures, a Jones fracture will usually heal if the foot is protected from the forces of weight bearing for a long enough period of time. However, the area of the bone that is fractured has a relatively poor blood supply, so bone healing may be slowed. Furthermore, because the fracture is often related to repetitive stress to the fracture site, there is always a concern that the fracture may recur.<br /><h3>Non-Operative Treatment</h3><br />Non-operative treatment usually includes:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li>Non-weight bearing (or limited weight bearing) for 6-8 weeks (or more) until the fracture heals</li><br /> 	<li>Crutches</li><br /> 	<li>A protective boot, such as a <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/cam-walker-walking-boot"><em>Cam walker</em></a></li><br /> 	<li>X-rays to assess the fracture healing prior to resuming increased weight-bearing</li><br /> 	<li>A gradual return to activities in a protective (stiff-soled) shoe, once adequate healing has occurred.</li><br /></ul><br /><h3>Operative Treatment</h3><br />Although the fracture will usually heal with rest, it can take a prolonged amount of time (due to the poor blood supply), and it can re-break due to the underlying alignment of the foot or lower extremity. For this reason, surgery will often be recommended for many individuals with Jones' fractures. This is particularly true for athletic individuals. The initial surgery involves stabilizing the fracture site by placing a strong screw through the middle of the bone (Figure 5). The stability helps the bone resist the forces that can slow healing, and drilling across the break stimulates blood flow to help healing. The after surgery treatment for this surgery is similar to that described above for non-operative management, but return to high level activities tends to be substantially quicker.<br /><h5>Figure 5:  Screw Fixation of a Jones Fracture</h5><br />^media_display_589c298cde9125bcb76930ba/position:center^<br /><h2>Potential Complications</h2><br /><span style="color: #444444; line-height: 24px;">The surgery to place a screw across the fracture site can be associated with <em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications">complications</a></strong></em>, including:</span><br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#infection">Infection</a></strong></em></li><br /> 	<li>Sural Nerve injury</li><br /> 	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems"><em><strong>Wound healing problems</strong></em></a></li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#non-union">Non-union</a></strong></em> (failure of the bone to heal, often due to continued loading to the area during a return to walking activities)</li><br /> 	<li>Increased fracturing of the bone at the time of surgery.

This reconstructive surgery would repair the fracture (often with bone grafting,) and involves changing the shape of the foot by cutting and repositioning one or more bones in the foot or lower leg. Common bone cutting procedures (osteotomies) may include:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="/calcaneal-osteotomy">Lateralizing calcaneal osteotomy</a></strong></em> - Cutting the heel bone and shifting it more to the outside</li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="/dorsiflexing-1st-metatarsal-osteotomy">Dorsiflexing 1st metatarsal osteotomy</a></strong></em> - Cutting a wedge out of the top of the 1st metatarsal (the bone that the big toe is attached to) so that this bone can be realigned. This is done because often in people with high arched feet, the 1st metatarsal is angled downward and acts like a &quot;kick-stand&quot; to force the foot to be excessively loaded on the outside.</li><br /></ul><br /><h2 style="font-size: 10px; text-align: right;"></h2><br /><p>Edited January 4, 2017</p>
Edited by <strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/christopher-w-digiovanni-md-editor/"><em>Christopher DiGiovanni, MD</em></a><br /></strong><h4></h4><br /><h2>Summary</h2><br />A Lisfranc injury is a significant injury that involves the midfoot and often has a prolonged recovery time. This injury constellation can involve any combination of fracture, joint dislocation, and/or joint subluxation (incomplete dislocation) to this anatomic region. By definition, a true Lisfranc injury involves at minimum a destabilizing injury to the ligamentous complex of the midfoot, resulting in incongruity and/or instability of one or more of the tarsometatarsal joints. Fractures alone in the midfoot are not necessarily a Lisfranc injury if no joint instability can be identified (instead, they are more aptly termed isolated fractures in the midfoot).  The more joint instability and fractures found in the midfoot, generally the more severe the LIsfranc injury.  Significant disruption of these midfoot ligaments (Figure 1), especially with superimposed fracture of the midfoot bones, typically leads to immediately and often chronic pain, swelling, and inability to weight-bear. During normal standing and walking, the ligaments of the midfoot are subject to forces that are 2-3 times body weight. These ligaments and bones must heal before normal walking can occur and this often takes many months. A stable injury to the midfoot, whereby these ligaments are injured (perhaps stretched or partially torn) but not rendered unstable, is more appropriately called a midfoot sprain rather than a true Lisfranc injury—even though the area involves the five “Lisfranc joints” comprising the tarsometarsal arch (tarsometatarsal joints 1-5).  A midfoot sprain occurs when some of the midfoot ligaments are incompletely torn, but the bones and midfoot joints remain  in their normal position—and are hence inherently stable and do not generally require surgery.  Stable Lisfranc injuries are treated with rest, immobilization, and often a period of non-weight-bearing. Legitimate Lisfranc injuries, on the other hand, are inherently unstable and involve a midfoot at risk of progressive articular collapse and/or incongruity, and these are generally operative problems.  True Lisfranc injuries are associated with a level of disruption of the midfoot ligaments that leads to malalignment of the midfoot joints (tarsometatarsal joints).  Because of this instability, these injuries should typically be treated with surgery to reposition and stabilize the joints.  Making the distinction between a midfoot sprain and an overt Lisfranc injury, therefore, is of paramount importance with respect to treatment, outcome, and prognosis.This anatomic region involving the midfoot articulations was originally described by Lisfranc (a Napoleonic era field surgeon).  He noted that riders who got their foot caught in the stirrup when they were knocked off their horses would suffer a serious injury of varying consequence (involving anywhere from one to all five of the tarsometatarsal articulations) to this constellation of joints.  As a result, he often needed to performed an amputation through the middle part of the foot. The joints through which he amputated now bear his name, as does the major stabilizing ligament that runs from the medial cuneiform to the 2nd metatarsal.<br /><table><br /><tbody><br /><tr><br /><td><br /><h5>Figure 1A: Lisfranc Joint</h5><br /></td><br /><td><br /><h5>Figure 1B:  Lisfranc Fracture</h5><br /></td><br /></tr><br /><tr><br /><td>^media_display_589c298dde9125bcb76930be/position:center^</td><br /><td>^media_display_589c2990de9125bcb76930c7/position:center^</td><br /></tr><br /></tbody><br /></table><br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />Lisfranc injuries typically occur when the midfoot is excessively loaded in abduction, external rotation, and/or dorsiflexion, leading to partial or complete tearing of the strong midfoot ligaments (Figure 1A and 1B). The primary forces also include axial loading (from heel toward toes), and some degree of rotation through the middle joints of the foot. This can occur via a number of mechanisms including:<br /><ul><br />	<li><em>A twisting injury</em> such as often occurs in sporting activities (ex. football), where the toes are planted on the ground and the heel is loaded.</li><br />	<li><em>A slip and twist to the foot</em> while descending a step or curb.</li><br />	<li><em>Impact of the foot on the brake pedal</em>, such as occurs in a motor vehicle crash.</li><br /></ul><br />Patients with Lisfranc injuries usually have significant swelling and pain in the midfoot, and can often exhibit bruising on the bottom of the midfoot. They find it difficult or impossible to weight-bear due to pain. There is a wide spectrum of Lisfranc-type injuries that can occur, from partial disruption of the ligaments with a stable bony position, to complete disruption of the joints with associated fractures and dislocations.  Because the ankle is often uninvolved, the injury may be minimized as just a “foot sprain”, so a high index of suspicion must be maintained to diagnose this injury in a timely manner.<br /><h2>Physical Examination</h2><br />Physical examination reveals specific tenderness to palpation across the midfoot region (Figure 2). There will often be significant swelling of the foot (Figure 3). Patients with Lisfranc injuries will not want to bear weight on the affected foot. In addition, manipulation of the bones of the midfoot will create significant discomfort, specifically twisting the foot downwards and to the outside (pronation and abduction of the forefoot). Bruising in the center plantar aspect (bottom) of the foot is common and should raise suspicion for a significant injury.<br /><h5>Figure 2:  Location of Pain</h5><br />^media_display_589c2991de9125bcb76930ca/position:center^<br /><h5>Figure 3: Bruising from Lisfranc Injury</h5><br />^media_display_589c2993de9125bcb76930cd/position:center^<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />X-rays are taken to identify whether the injury is displaced or non-displaced. Weight-bearing foot x-rays are helpful to determine if the midfoot injury is stable (sprain) or unstable (Lisfranc).  Obtaining a comparison film of the other foot is beneficial to see the normal alignment of the person’s foot (which can vary from person to person). A CT scan or MRI may be necessary if the diagnosis or the extent of the injury is unclear.   Small bony detail in this region of the foot, as well as subtle fractures and joint displacements, may be more easily identified with advanced imaging. Occasionally, it may be necessary to perform stress x-rays (obtaining an X-ray while twisting the foot) to determine the stability of significant but occult midfoot instability. These tests are important, because they are dynamic assessments of a dynamic problem.  CT and MRI scans are more static assessments of these injuries, and can sometimes miss the occult injuries.<br /><h2>Classification</h2><br />There are several classification systems for LisFranc injuries, however the crucial determination is whether or not the injury is stable or unstable.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br /><i>Stable Lisfranc injuries</i> are usually treated non-operatively. This involves immobilization in either a cast or a prefabricated boot. Patients often need at least a 6-week period where they are either non-weight bearing or minimally weight bearing. In a stable injury, the midfoot ligaments are strained but still intact, so once an adequate amount of healing has occurred, patients can increase their activity level. However, even with a non-displaced injury that is consistent with midfoot sprain, full recovery can still take many months.<i>Displaced (Unstable) Lisfranc injuries </i>(displaced and/or occultly unstable midfoot joints) are usually treated surgically. Surgery is performed to restore joint alignment and stabilize the joint(s) with screws and sometimes plates (Figure 4). This allows the bones and the ligaments to be reduced and then held in place, which gives the ligaments a chance to heal.  In some cases, it is necessary to fuse the involved joints (connect the two bones forever), eliminating the motion altogether.  It is not uncommon that once the injury has healed removal of the hardware will be necessary, requiring another surgical procedure. Recovery can take upwards of a year.<br /><h5>Figure 4: Surgical Treatment of Lisfranc Injury</h5><br />^media_display_589c2994de9125bcb76930d0/position:center^<br /><h2>Recovery From Surgery</h2><br />Recovery from midfoot sprains or overt Lisfranc injuries are lengthy, because the midfoot must absorb tremendous stress during routine stance and gait (weightbearing, stair climbing, walking, running, etc). Post surgical treatment and rehabilitation efforts are thus dependent upon the nature of the initial injury, specific surgical treatment, and the surgeon’s preference. For a major Lisfranc injury, a typical recovery protocol would include:<br /><ul><br />	<li>2 to 3 week period of splinted non weightbearing, until swelling and discomfort settle down, and, if surgery was required, sutures can be removed.</li><br />	<li>6- to 8-week period of gradually progressive partial weight bearing in a specialized brace or cast.</li><br />	<li>Gradual transition to weight bearing as tolerated in a specialized walking boot for an additional 4-8 weeks.</li><br />	<li>Wean from the boot to a stiff sole shoe at 10-14 weeks from surgery, perhaps with subsequent use of a customized semirigid midfoot arch support.</li><br /></ul><br />A displaced injury takes many months of recovery. The majority of the recovery occurs in the first 6 months, but it is often a year or more before patients reach their point of maximal improvement.If the surgical treatment fails or the joint damage from the injury leads to severe arthritis, then a <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/surgical-procedures/midfoot-fusion/">fusion (arthrodesis) of the Lisfranc joints</a> may be necessary. Despite the stiffness of a fused joint, most patients with successful fusion of the midfoot joints have good function of the foot.<b></b><br /><p>Edited on December 23, 2015</p>

The term literally means &quot;pain on the metatarsal&quot; (there are 5 metatarsal bones in the forefoot). Metatarsalgia is not a true diagnosis, but rather it is a symptom. Patients with metatarsalgia present with pain in their forefoot, usually in the ball of the foot (Figure 1). The pain is often described as aching, and it is typically aggravated by standing and walking. In general, metatarsalgia is caused by repetitive overloading of the forefoot, leading to chronic localized tissue injury. Often the most symptomatic area is at the base of the 2nd or 3rd toe. Factors that may predispose to the development of metatarsalgia include: a bunion deformity, arthritis of the great toe, ligament instability of the midfoot, an excessively tight calf muscle, a congenital foot deformity, and claw toe deformities.<em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Metatarsalgia-Patient-Handout-November-2015.pdf" target="_blank">Click here for a detailed summary handout on Metatarsalgia</a></strong></em><em>Non-operative treatment of metatarsalgia is often successful. Treatment principles include:</em><br /><ol><br /> 	<li><em>Making the correct diagnosis and addressing the underlying cause of the symptom.</em></li><br /> 	<li><em>Diminishing the repetitive loading through the forefoot.</em></li><br /> 	<li><em>Dispersing the loading on the forefoot over a wider area.</em></li><br /></ol><br /><table style="border: none !important;"><br /><tbody><br /><tr><br /><td style="border: none !important;"><br /><h5>Figure 1: Typical Pain location</h5><br /></td><br /><td style="border: none !important;"><br /><h5>Figure 2: Localized forefoot load</h5><br /></td><br /></tr><br /><tr><br /><td style="border: none !important;"><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Metatarsalgia-figure-1.jpg">^media_display_589c2995de9125bcb76930d4/position:center^</a></td><br /><td style="border: none !important;"><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Metatarsalgia-figure-2.jpg">^media_display_589c2996de9125bcb76930d7/position:center^</a></td><br /></tr><br /></tbody><br /></table><br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />The pain that is experienced in metatarsalagia typically occurs in the forefoot, at the base of the second or third toes (under the second or third metatarsal head). It often feels like walking &quot;on stones or pebbles&quot; or on &quot;a rolled up sock&quot; at the base of the involved toes. The pain is often described as aching, and it is aggravated by standing and walking, particularly on hard surfaces. There may also be a burning sensation extending into the tips of the toes.As the condition progresses, it may be associated with increased <em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/claw-toes/">clawing of the toes</a></em>. This can cause the fatty tissue that provides shock absorption to the forefoot to no longer be located under the weight-bearing bones of the forefoot (distal migration of the plantar fat pad leaving the metatarsal heads and the metatarso-phalangeal joints (MTP) joints without the padding or &quot;uncovered&quot;). This results in less protection for the metatarsal heads; less shock absorption as they bear weight, callus formation, and worsening of the symptoms.Unfortunately for some patients, the cause of metatarsalagia is hidden by the secondary <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/claw-toes/"><em>clawtoe deformity</em> </a>that develops and worsens the symptoms. If an ink imprint of the weight bearing sole of the foot is obtained, such as with a Harris mat (a device that assesses how force is distributed throughout the foot), there is often an intense uptake in the area corresponding to the involved metatarsal head(s) (Figure 2). Continued, localized, repetitive loading to the involved area will predispose to chronic injury to the structures being loaded. The structures that are commonly injured include the MTP joint capsule, the plantar plate, and the metatarsal bone (head and/or neck). The irritation of the MTP joint is due to repetitive overload, and can lead to swelling of the joint itself. Patients are unable to bend the toes completely and show the ‘knuckles’ on the top. Often in early stages the toes start separating. This condition is called as MTP joint synovitis.<br /><div style="border: 1px solid #ffffff; background: #f9f9f9; padding: 12px;"><strong>Note:</strong> Many patients and physicians misdiagnose a <em><strong><a href="/mortons-neuroma">Morton's neuroma</a></strong></em> for other forms of metatarsagia. While Morton's neuroma is a cause of metatarsalgia, neuritis (nerve inflammation) secondary to the chronic repetitive joint injury is far more common. In this situation removing the Morton's nerve may lead to incomplete and temporary pain relief.</div><br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />X-rays in patients with metatarsalgia often demonstrate a long second or third metatarsal, relative to the first and the fourth metatarsalgia. In rare instances, the MTP joint may actually be subluxed (partially out of joint) or even dislocated. Deformities of the 1st metatarsal, such as those present with a <em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/bunions-hallux-valgus">Bunion</a></em> or with midfoot instability, may also be observed on x-ray.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br /><h3>Non-Operative Treatment</h3><br />Patients respond well to non-operative treatment. If the underlying cause can be addressed, non-operative treatment will be successful in the longterm. The principle of non-operative treatment is to off-load the involved area. This can be done with a combination of <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/non-operative-treatment/comfort-shoes/">comfort shoes</a>, <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/frequently-asked-questions/how-do-i-fit-a-metatarsal-pad/">metatarsal pads</a>, <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/foot-and-ankle-medical-supplies/pre-fabricated-over-the-counter-orthotics-insert/">soft accommodative orthotics</a>, <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/non-operative-treatment/activity-modification/">activity modifications</a>, <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/foot-and-ankle-physical-therapy/calf-stretch/">calf stretching</a>, foot muscle strengthening, and <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/non-operative-treatment/non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory-drugs-nsaids/">NSAIDS</a> (Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs).<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="/comfort-shoes">Comfort shoes</a></strong>: </em>Unfortunately, heels and pointed toe shoes will worsen the symptoms, by concentrating weight bearing on the forefoot. Shoes that are characterized by a stiff sole and a slight rocker bottom contour can help disperse force away from the forefoot. Orthopaedic shoes of the past carry a negative connotation of an ugly, unstylish, men's Oxford which are rejected by many patients. Currently, many women's and men's dress and athletic shoe manufacturers carry lines with more style and the same features.</li><br /> 	<li><strong><em><a href="/how-do-i-fit-a-metatarsal-pad">Metatarsal pads</a></em></strong>: Metatarsal pads can be very helpful in this condition (Figure 3). When metatarsal pads are fitted appropriately, they will help bear weight away from the metatarsal heads that are involved.  As noted in Figure 3 to be effective a metatarsal pad needs to be positioned before the main area of loading.</li><br /></ul><br /><h5>Figure 3: Metatarsal Pad</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Metatarsalgia-figure-3.jpg">^media_display_589c2996de9125bcb76930da/position:center^</a><br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/pre-fabricated-over-the-counter-orthotics-insert">Soft Orthotics</a></strong>: </em>Soft accommodative orthotics can also help to cushion the localized force, and thereby decrease the tendency for repetitive injury to the involved area.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Hammertoe crest pad: </em>For patients with an associated clawtoe deformity, it may be helpful to use a hammertoe crest pad, or toe taping, to help bring the toe back into an improved position. This may serve to help reposition the thick plantar fat pad under the prominent metatarsal head.</li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/activity-modification">Activity modification</a></strong>: </em>A calf muscle contracture (equinus contracture) will increase stress on the forefoot. Stretching the calf will help eliminate this cause of pain. After the joints become irritated, the small muscles (intrinsic muscles) of the foot often become weak, which serves to spreads the symptoms. Strengthening these muscles through foot specific exercises will improve the contraction, and lead to better more tolerated loading through the foot.</li><br /> 	<li><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/non-operative-treatment/non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory-drugs-nsaids/">Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</a>: </em>NSAIDs can be very helpful if symptoms are moderate or severe, as they can modify the perception of symptoms, giving other non-operative treatments time to allow the overloaded area to heal.</li><br /> 	<li><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/non-operative-treatment/corticosteroid-injections/">Corticosteroid Injection</a>: </em>Injecting corticosteroids into the involved joint can give temporary relief (1-3 months) in certain cases. If performed repetitively, cortisone may cause ligament degeneration and precipitate a toe deformity.</li><br /></ul><br /><h3>Operative Treatment</h3><br />In a small percentage of patients, non-operative treatment will fail. In these patients, surgery may be helpful. There are a variety of procedures that have been proposed, either in isolation or in combination.It is essential that the primary cause of the metatarsalgia be addressed. If a &quot;<em><strong><a href="/claw-toes">clawtoe</a></strong></em>&quot; is present, it may be necessary to address this deformity surgically. By successfully correcting the toe deformity, the shock-absorbing plantar fat pad can be reduced under the metatarsal heads. There are a variety of different ways to <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/surgical-procedures/clawtoe-correction/">surgically correct a clawtoe deformity</a>. The technique chosen will depend on the extent of the deformity, the stiffness of the toe, and the preference of the surgeon. If the joint at the base of the involved toe (MTP joint) is swollen and inflamed, it may be helpful to remove the inflamed synovial lining (synovectomy). This is often done in conjunction with other procedures. If the second and/or third metatarsal heads are long, it may be beneficial to perform a <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/weil-metatarsal-shortening-osteotomy/">metatarsal shortening osteotomy</a>, such as a Weil osteotomy. By shortening the metatarsal between 3 mm and 6 mm, the loading characteristics can be changed and the tendency to load one or more of the metatarsal heads can be altered. If a <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/bunions-hallux-valgus">Bunion </a></strong></em>deformity is present, this deformity may need to be corrected in order to address the abnormal weight bearing of the forefoot. If a tight calf muscle is present and does not resolve with stretching, <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/gastrocnemius-slide-strayer-procedure">lengthening of the gastrocnemius muscle (Strayer procedure)</a></strong></em> may be beneficial.<br /><h2>General Potential Complications</h2><br />The usual list of general post-surgical complications may occur with various procedures that are used to address metatarsalgia. This includes the potential for:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems">Wound healing problems</a></strong></em></li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#infection">Infection</a></strong></em></li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#non-union">Nonunion (if the PIP joint is fused)</a></strong></em></li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#nerve-injury">Nerve injury</a></strong></em> to the local nerves that provide sensation to the tips of the toes</li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#dvt">Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)</a></strong></em> - uncommon</li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#pe">Pulmonary Embolism (PE)</a></strong></em> - very uncommon</li><br /></ul><br /><h2>Specific Complications</h2><br />Surgery on the toes and forefoot is not as predictable or as easy as patients think. Specific complications depend on the procedure(s) that are performed but can include:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em>Continued symptoms</em>. It is often difficult to eradicate all, or even most of the symptoms because metatarsalgia is typically a chronic problem. There is a certain amount of tissue damage that has already been done and can not be undone. In some instances, patients are made worse by surgery.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Stiffness of the toe</em>. Toes that have been operated on almost invariably lose some flexibility. Usually this is not a major problem, but in some instances it can lead to discomfort.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Recurrent deformity of the toe</em>. Toe surgery is performed in an attempt to correct or improve the deformity and associated symptoms. However, balancing and positioning the toe can be tricky, and a recurrent cock-up deformity of the toe can occur.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Numbness to all or part of the toe</em>. Although unlikely, it is possible that the sensation to part or all of the toe may be lost following surgery, as the small nerves that supply sensation to the toe are close to the operative site.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Transfer metatarsalgia.</em> Surgery that corrects a claw toe or moves one of the metatarsal bones, may alter the loading characteristics of the front of the foot. This may lead to increase pain in another, previously less symptomatic part of the foot.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Loss of blood supply to the tip of the toe</em> In rare instances, the blood supply to the tip of the toe is severely attenuated. There are two small arteries (one on either side of the toe) which supply blood to the tip of the toe. In some patients, one of these vessels may be absent. If the blood supply to the tip of the toe is lost the tissue will die and it may be necessary to amputate part, or all of the toe.</li><br /></ul><br /><h4><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Metatarsalgia-Patient-Handout-November-2015.pdf" target="_blank">Click here for a detailed summary handout on Metatarsalgia</a></strong></em></h4><br /><p><strong><em><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></em></strong><span style="color: #000000;">Edited</span> on December 28, 2016</p><br />

This is usually exacerbated by standing and walking. It can be painful first thing in the morning for the first few steps, and also after getting up from a sitting or lying position. This is due to “start-up” pain.Occasionally, there is a history of significant injury to the midfoot, such as a <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/lisfranc-injury-fracture-midfoot-sprain/">Lisfranc fracture.</a>  More commonly, the midfoot arthritis occurs from gradual wear and tear.<br /><h2>Physical Examination</h2><br />Physical examination may reveal swelling in the midfoot.  There is often generalized tenderness in the midfoot area. A bony prominence in the midfoot is common.  However, not all bony prominences in this area represent  arthritis. It is not uncommon for people to have local shoe wear irritation from a bony prominence, known as a <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/tarsal-boss">tarsal boss</a>. This does not necessarily signify significant midfoot arthritis.<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />Weight-bearing x-rays will demonstrate loss of joint space in the midfoot joints, which is characteristic of arthritis. The joint between the midfoot and forefoot (tarsometatarsal or “Lisfranc” joint) is most commonly involved, although the smaller joints of the midfoot (intercuneiform joints) may also be involved.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br /><h3>Non-Operative Treatment</h3><br />Midfoot arthritis can often be managed successfully without surgery. The key components of non-operative treatment are:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/comfort-shoes"><em>A stiff-soled comfort shoe:</em></a> By having a stiff sole, the amount of force concentrated in the midfoot will be limited.  In a similar manner, a slight rocker contour to the shoe will help disperse the force away from the midfoot and smoothly up the leg.</li><br /> 	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/activity-modification"><em>Activity Modification: </em></a>Activity modification to limit the amount of the time that the patient stands and the number of steps the patient takes, will also be helpful in limiting symptoms.</li><br /> 	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/weight-loss"><em>Weight-loss: </em></a>Losing excess weight will help to decrease the amount of force going through the arthritic midfoot with each step.</li><br /> 	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/calf-stretch"><em>Calf Stretching </em></a><em>(Flexibilty improvement of adjacent joints)</em>: Unnecessary motion or stress through the midfoot can be decreased by stretching the calf muscle (gastrocsoleus complex and heel cord)</li><br /> 	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory-drugs-nsaids"><em>Anti-inflammatory Medications:</em></a> Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) may also be beneficial.

However, this will usually not help the arthritic pain. Therefore, if an operation is deemed necessary, it is often necessary to fuse the involved joints (<a href="http://www.footeducation.com/surgical-procedures/midfoot-fusion/">midfoot fusion</a>). By eliminating the movement through the arthritic joints, the pain originating from these joints is eradicated. Essentially, it converts a painful stiff joint to a painless stiff joint. However, a midfoot fusion does not preclude pain from other joints and other areas of the foot from continuing to be symptomatic.This type of surgery requires strong fixation and a period of non-weight bearing (or limited weight bearing) for 6-8 weeks.<br /><h2>Potential Complications</h2><br />Complications of surgery may include:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications"><em><strong>Nonunion</strong></em></a></li><br /> 	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications"><em><strong>Delayed union</strong></em></a></li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#infection">Infection</a></strong></em></li><br /> 	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems"><em><strong>Wound healing problems</strong></em></a></li><br /> 	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications"><em><strong>Nerve injury or irritation</strong></em></a></li><br /> 	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#dvt"><em><strong>Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT or Blood clot)</strong></em></a></li><br /> 	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#pe"><em><strong>Pulmonary embolism (PE)</strong></em></a></li><br /></ul><br />In addition, patients may have persistent pain, as the fusion of the midfoot joint will not help pain that originates from other areas of the foot, such as tendons, ligaments, or other joints.<br /><p>Edited November 30, 2016 (previously edited by <strong><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/robert-leland-md-editor" target="_blank">Robert Leland MD</a></em>)</strong></p>

The symptoms from Morton's neuroma are due to irritation to the small digital nerves, as they pass across the sole of the foot and into the toes (Figure 1). Therefore, with a true Morton's neuroma, it is not uncommon to have nerve-type symptoms, which can include numbness or a burning sensation extending into the toes. There are several interdigital nerves in the forefoot. The most common nerve to develop into a neuroma is between the 3rd and 4th toes. With a true neuroma, the pain that radiates and the numbness or tingling should be isolated to adjacent sides of just one or two toes.<br /><h5>Figure 1: Location of Nerve (between the base of the 2nd and 3rd toes)</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Morton-Neuroma-Figure-1.jpg">^media_display_589c2998de9125bcb76930df/position:center^</a>In many cases, a neuroma may develop as a result of excessive loading on the front of the foot. Such a loading for example can occur in those who regularly wear high heels with a narrow toe box. Sometimes, a patient’s anatomic alignment in the forefoot contributes to the overload. There may be some cases where the neuroma develops spontaneously, for no obvious reason. However, once the nerve is irritated, pressure from walking, and from the adjacent bony prominences (metatarsal heads), as well as from the intermetatarsal ligament that binds the heads together, all may contribute to persistent pain. (Figure 2). Repetitive pressure on the nerve causes localized injury with resulting scarring and fibrosis of the nerve. This leads to symptoms in the distribution of the nerve.Patients will feel pain that worsens with walking, particularly when walking in shoes with thin soles or high heels. Also, anything that squeezes the metatarsal heads together may aggravate symptoms, such as narrow shoes. A patient may feel the need to remove the shoe and rub the foot to soothe the pain.<br /><h5>Figure 2: Location of nerve right under the skin (between base of 3rd and 4th toes)</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Morton-Neuroma-Figure-2.png">^media_display_589c299fde9125bcb76930e2/position:center^</a><br /><h2>Physical Examination</h2><br />Patients with classic Morton's neuroma symptoms will have pain with pressure at the base of the involved toes (either between the 2nd and 3rd toes, or between the 3rd and 4th toes) (Figure 3).  In addition, squeezing the front of the foot together can exacerbate symptoms. As well, they may have numbness on the sides of one toe and the adjacent toe, as this corresponds with the distribution of the involved nerve (Figure 4).<br /><h5>Figure 3: Typical Pain locations</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Morton-Neuroma-Figure-3.png">^media_display_589c29a0de9125bcb76930e5/position:center^</a><br /><h5>Figure 4: Distribution of involved nerve</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Morton-Neuroma-Figure-4.png">^media_display_589c29a2de9125bcb76930e8/position:center^</a><br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />Plain x-rays of the foot may demonstrate that one or more of the metatarsals are long (Figure 5). Not uncommonly, the second and/or third metatarsal may be long relative to the third or fourth. This can create a situation where excessive load is occurring in and around the vicinity of the interdigital nerve.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br /><h3>Non-Operative Treatment</h3><br />Most non-operative treatment is usually successful, although it can take a while to figure out what combination of non-operative treatment works best for each individual patient.  Non-operative treatment may include:<br /><ol><br /> 	<li>The use of <em><a href="/comfort-shoes">comfort shoe wear</a></em>.</li><br /> 	<li>The use of a <em><a href="/how-do-i-fit-a-metatarsal-pad">metatarsal pad</a></em> to decrease the load through the involved area of the plantar forefoot.</li><br /> 	<li>A period of<em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/activity-modification"> activity modification</a></em> to decrease or eliminate activities, which may be exacerbating the patient's symptoms.  For example, avoiding long periods of standing or other activities that result in significant repetitive loading to the forefoot can be very helpful.  Wearing high heels should be avoided.</li><br /> 	<li>Local can help decrease inflammation associated with the nerve. However, this does not necessarily address the underlying loading forces that may be causing the injury to the nerve in the first place.</li><br /></ol><br />It has been proposed that an alcohol injection in and around the nerve will cause a controlled death to the nerve and subsequently eliminate symptoms. In theory, this may be helpful. In practice, adequate prospective studies have not demonstrated the benefit of this procedure above and beyond the other standard, non-operative treatments available. In addition, there is the concern that the alcohol will cause excessive scarring and damage to other important structures in the area.<br /><h3>Operative Treatment</h3><br />Operative treatment of Morton’s neuroma should be entertained only after failure of non-operative management and only if it can be ascertained that the symptoms are not primarily due to any other pathology such as synovitis of the metatarso-phalangeal joint.Standard operative treatment involves identifying the nerve and cutting (resecting) it proximal to the point where it is irritated/injured. This is usually done through an incision on the top (dorsal) aspect of the foot, although an incision on the sole (plantar) aspect of the foot can be used.Some physicians will attempt to treat Morton’s neuroma by releasing the intermetatarsal ligament, and freeing the nerve from the pressure under the ligament or any local scar tissue. This may also be beneficial.The ultimate success of a Morton's neuroma treated surgically can be variable. In cases where the underlying problem is only an irritated nerve (a true Morton’s neuroma), then surgery will probably be curative (although it may take a few months for the foot to fully heal). But in many cases, forefoot pain is more complex. There may be an irritated nerve or two causing pain, but the real problem is often excessive loading of the lesser metatarsals. The generic term for this condition is <em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/metatarsalgia">metatarsalgia</a></em>. When considering surgery, identifying and addressing these problems may lead to a better end result.<br /><h2>Potential Surgical Complications</h2><br />Potential operative complications include:<br /><ol><br /> 	<li><em>Delayed healing</em>. It is not unusual for mild residual swelling at the surgical site to cause persistent discomfort for 2-3 months.</li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#infection">Infection</a></strong></em>.</li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems">Wound healing problems</a></strong></em>. Wound healing problems can be particularly problematic if the incision is on the plantar surface of the foot, as scars in this area can be quite troublesome.</li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#dvt">Deep Vein Thrombosis</a></strong></em> (DVT).</li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#pe">Pulmonary embolism</a></strong></em> (PE).</li><br /> 	<li><em>Continued pain</em>.

In some instances, an aggravation of the nerve, such as what may occur at the time of the surgery, can lead to the development of a complex regional pain syndrome, which can be quite troublesome. Fortunately, this complication is relatively uncommon.</li><br /></ol><br /><p>Edited December 28, 2016 (Originally edited by <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/justin-greisberg-md-editor" target="_blank"><strong><em>Justin Greisberg MD</em></strong></a>)</p>
Edited by <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/mark-perry-md/"><em><strong>Mark Perry, MD</strong></em></a><br /><h2>Summary</h2><br />Navicular stress fractures (NSF) are uncommon but serious injuries, characterized by a chronic midfoot ache.  The cause is a repetitive chronic load to the midfoot, often from dynamic sporting-type activities. NSF is difficult to diagnose as it may not be seen on regular X-Rays. Treatment involves a period of prolonged non-weight-bearing.  Navicular stress fractures that are not healing may require surgery to stabilize the fracture with one or more screws.<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />Patients who develop navicular stress fractures will present with a chronic mid-foot ache.  Although anyone can get NSF, the most common presentation is in the athlete.  However, unlike a typical<em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/2nd-metatarsal-stress-fractures-or-march-fracture/"> stress fracture of the metatarsals</a></em> (which are much more common), these loading episodes tend to be more dynamic.   Some examples include the lead foot of an active golfer, a middle distance runner, or any college or professional athlete performing dynamic repetitive activities.The symptoms are often generalized to the mid-foot.  The relatively vague location of the symptoms makes NSF difficult to diagnose.  Pain may be with athletic activities only; however, some patients might even have a limp while walking.<br /><h2>Physical Examination</h2><br />Physical examination will demonstrate a generalized tenderness around the top of the mid-foot. An astute physician may be able to localize the tenderness to the top of the navicular bone.  Certainly, attempts to hop or rise up on the toes of the affected foot will be painful.  There is some suggestion that patients with slightly higher arch feet, as well as patients with an unusually long second toe (the second toe is usually the longest toe anyway),  may have an increased risk of developing navicular stress fractures. These two situations may increase the force into the navicular, particularly in patients doing activities that involve them getting up on their toes such as sprinting and jumping.  But most commonly, the person with a Navicular Stress Fracture has a normally-aligned foot.<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />X-rays are often read as normal. Sometimes a subtle fracture line can be identified. In more advanced cases, or in cases where there is degeneration of the talonavicular joint, x-rays will be abnormal.Diagnosis can be made with an MRI, a CT scan, or a bone scan. An MRI or a CT scan will allow the fracture orientation to be identified. In addition, those studies will allow determination of whether the fracture is complete or incomplete through the bone.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br />Navicular stress fractures can be difficult to treat due to the poor blood supply to the navicular (a good blood supply is needed for healing of any bone injury), and the fairly extensive force that this bone absorbs in both normal walking and in sporting type activities.Good results have been reported when treating undisplaced navicular stress fractures with treatment involving casting, and a period of non-weightbearing of 6 weeks.  Success rates of 85-90% have been reported with this treatment method.  Many doctors will also recommend the use of a bone stimulator, which is designed to encourage bone healing.  However, there is no clear evidence that the stimulator shortens the time to healing.Surprisingly, if the patient walks on the cast, the rate of healing may fall as low as 25%. It is common to require three, four, or more months to make a full recovery from an undisplaced navicular stress fracture, and it may be a season-ending injury for an athlete. Unfortunately, patients who have developed a navicular stress fracture are at risk for having a recurrent fracture, because the original reasons for the NSF are usually unchanged even after the fracture has healed.Surgery may be recommended for some patients, especially if an initial period of non-operative treatment is not successful.  Surgery may include drilling across the fracture, placement of one or more screws, and possibly the addition of a bone graft to improve healing.  Surgery usually results in successful healing, but a period of rest and non-weight bearing is required after surgery, and overall recovery time is still prolonged.<br /><h3>Displaced Navicular Stress Fractures</h3><br />In rare cases, a navicular fracture may go on to displace.  Non-operative treatment is no longer appropriate; surgery is needed to reduce the fracture (set it in exact position), hold it in place with screws, and possibly add a bone graft.<br /><h2>Potential Complications of Navicular Stress Fractures</h2><br />The most obvious and concerning potential problem with non-operative treatment is persistence of the fracture and the accompanying pain.  If the fracture is not showing signs of healing, then surgery should be considered.In rare cases, the navicular bone can collapse.  This may be part of a more complex and rare disease.  Collapse compromises function of the hindfoot joints, and is difficult to manage.If a navicular fracture heals in poor alignment, arthritis of the associated joint (the talonavicular joint) will set in, with resulting pain and stiffness.  Surgery to fuse the talonavicular joint can alleviate much of the midfoot pain associated with talonavicular arthritis. However, it has a fairly prolonged recovery time of six or more weeks of non-weight bearing. In addition, it greatly increases the stiffness of the midfoot. <br /><p align="right">Edited on December 14, 2016 (Originally edited by <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/justin-greisberg-md-editor" target="_blank"><strong><em>Justin Greisberg, MD</em></strong></a>)</p><br /> 
Edited by <strong><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/kenneth-j-hunt-md-editor/">Kenneth Hunt, MD</a></em></strong><br /><h2>Summary</h2><br />An osteochondral lesion of the talus (OLT) is an area of abnormal, damaged cartilage and bone on the top of the talus bone (the lower bone of the ankle joint).  This condition is also known as either osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) of the talus or as a talar osteochondral lesion (OCL).  It is often associated with a traumatic injury, such as a severe ankle sprain. However, it can also occur from chronic overload due to malalignment or instability of the ankle joint.OCLs most commonly occur in two areas of the talus (Figure 1A and 1B):<br /><ol><br /> 	<li>The inside and top part of the lower bone of the ankle (the medial talar dome) or</li><br /> 	<li>The outside and top part of the lower bone of the ankle (the antero-lateral talar dome).</li><br /></ol><br /><h5>Figure 1: MRI of Medial (Inside) Talar OLT</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/OCD-Figure-1.jpg">^media_display_589c29a3de9125bcb76930ed/position:center^</a><br /><h5>Figure 1B: MRI of Lateral (Outside) Talar OCL</h5><br />^media_display_589c29a5de9125bcb76930f3/position:center^<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />Many patients with talar OLTs are asymptomatic. OLTs can be serendipitously identified on an MRI ordered to assess another problem. However, if the lesion is large enough, or the overlying cartilage is displaced, talar OLTs can be quite symptomatic. Patients with this condition often complain of localized ankle pain, as well as discomfort on either the inside (medial talar OLT) or outside (anterolateral talar OLT) of the ankle. The pain is often worse with activities, particularly running, walking and jumping. They may also complain of mechanical symptoms, such as clicking and popping sounds associated with the osteochondral lesion, if there is a loose fragment of cartilage and/or bone associated with the OLT. Increased ankle pain with activity is also common. OLTs on the top outside part of the talus (Antero-lateral lesions) usually have a history of a traumatic injury with a twisting component, such as an <em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/sprained-ankle/">ankle sprain</a></em>. Whereas, the OLTs on the inside part of the top of the talus (medial talar osteochondral lesions) are more commonly associated with chronic overload of the medial aspect of the ankle, such as would occur in a patient with a higher arched foot (<em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/biomechanics-of-foot-and-ankle/foot-types/characteristics-of-high-arched-foot-subtle-cavus/">subtle cavus foot</a>).</em> Physical exam usually reveals some swelling and localized pain along the front of the ankle (ankle joint line).<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />Plain x-rays can be used to help diagnose an osteochondral lesion. Areas of decreased density (i.e., darker areas) seen on the plain x-rays (Figure 2) can be indicative of this condition, although it is not uncommon for the plain x-rays to be read as normal. The gold standard for diagnosis of talar OLTs is an MRI of the ankle (Figure 3A and 3B).<br /><h5>Figure 2: Medial Talar OLT on plain X-Rays</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/OCD-Figure-3.jpg">^media_display_589c29a6de9125bcb76930fc/position:center^</a><br /><h5>Figure 3A: MRI Lateral (side) view of Talar OLT</h5><br />^media_display_589c29a7de9125bcb7693105/position:center^<br /><h5>Figure 3B: MRI Anteroposterior (view from front) of Talar OLT</h5><br />^media_display_589c29a7de9125bcb769310b/position:center^<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br /><h3>Non-Operative Treatment</h3><br />Non-operative treatment can be successful for non-displaced talar OLTs, especially if the condition is recognized and treated relatively early, and the lesion is relatively small. Younger patients, particularly growing children or adolescents, have a much better chance of healing an OLT compared to adults. There are several non-operative management options for the treatment of osteochondral lesions, including:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em>Cast immobilization</em>: If the OLT occurs following an acute injury, initial immobilization in a cast for 4-6 weeks can help reduce stress on the OLT and allow healing.  This treatment approach can be initially attempted in non-displaced OLTs.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Physical therapy</em>: working on strengthening the muscles around the ankle, range of motion of the ankle, and balancing (<em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/proprioception-exercises">proprioception</a></em>)</li><br /> 	<li><em>Protective braces</em> (ex. <em><a href="/ankle-lacers">Ankle Lacer</a></em>) to decrease stress can also be utilized.</li><br /></ul><br />In younger patients, this condition has the potential to heal, making it possible to treat acute non-displaced talar OCLs with immobilization in a cast or <em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/foot-and-ankle-medical-supplies/cam-walker-walking-boot/">CAM walker</a></em>.<br /><h3>Operative Treatment</h3><br />Surgical treatment is indicated for displaced talar OLTs or lesions that have not improved with appropriate non-operative management. Surgical treatment of talar OLTs includes:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em><a href="/ankle-arthroscopy">Arthroscopic debridement</a> (cleaning out) and microfracture of the talar OLT. </em>This is the standard operative treatment and leads to good or excellent results in 75-80% of patients with typical talar OCLs (less than 15mm²)</li><br /> 	<li><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/surgical-procedures/osteochondral-autologous-autograft-oats-procedure/">Osteochondral Autologous Autograft Transfer</a> (OATs Procedure)</em> An OATs-type procedure is reserved for patients who have been treated with arthroscopic cleaning out (debridement) and microfracture and are still not doing well, or patients that have a very large (&gt;20mm²) talar OLT. This procedure may also be called a mosaicplasty. The theoretical advantage of this procedure is that it replaces the damaged cartilage with real cartilage from the patient, taken from somewhere else (ex. the knee joint). The main disadvantage of this procedure is the prolonged recovery time and increased complication rate, compared to arthroscopic debridement. The graft is usually taken (harvested) from the patient’s knee on the same leg, from an area of that joint that does not bear any load. Patients can develop knee pain after this procedure.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Osteochondral Allograft Transfer (i.e., Cadaver):</em> A bone and cartilage plug may also be obtained from a cadaver and transplanted into the OLT. This prevents the need from harvesting bone and cartilage from another part of the body (ex. knee). However, blood tests must be performed to ensure that the donor specimen is free of diseases (ex. HIV, Hep B, etc.), which this takes time. During this time, many of the cartilage cells in the donor graft die, which may affect the integrity of the graft after it has been inserted. Osteochondral allografts (Cadaver grafts) have been used to treat large talar lesions with some success. However, the larger the graft, the more likely it seems that it will collapse as a new blood supply is established into the graft after transplantation. This is one of the reasons that complete ankle replacement using all cadaver (donor) bone and cartilage has not done as well as orthopaedic surgeons had initially hoped.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Autologous chondrocyte transplantation (ACI):</em> There has been an attempt to harvest a patient's own healthy cartilage, grow the cells in a lab, and then reimplant these cells back into the area where the cartilage has been lost. Unfortunately this approach has not yet met with the type of clinical success that had been hoped for, and is not currently broadly available. One of the barriers to this technique that has been difficult to overcome is that the cartilage cells themselves represent only a tiny portion of the &quot;normal cartilage&quot;.  A much greater part is the surrounding &quot;matrix&quot;, which is highly organized in normal cartilage and which has not yet been reproduced in the laboratory. The “subchondral” bone that supports cartilage is also important to clinical success. Laboratory and clinical work continue in this area.</li><br /></ul><br /><h2>Other Procedures</h2><br />Any other significant pathology that exists may also need to be addressed at the time of surgery.

Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/vinod-k-panchbhavi-md-editor" target="_blank">Vinod Panchbhavi, MD</a></strong></em><br /><h2>Summary: Peroneal Tenonitis</h2><br />Peroneal tendonitis is an irritation to the tendons that run in a groove, behind the bony prominence on the outer aspect of the ankle. The two tendons involved are the peroneus longus and peroneus brevis. The tendonitis usually occurs because these tendons are subject to excessive repetitive forces during standing and walking. Certain types of feet (ex. high arched feet or feet with misaligned heels that are inclined or tilted inwards) tend to increase the force that the peroneal tendons are exposed to, and are predisposed to the risk of peroneal tendonitis. Treatment is aimed at decreasing symptoms and correcting any precipitating factor. Non-operative treatment may include: anti-inflammatory medications, activity modification, ice, muscle strengthening, ankle bracing, and/or specific types of shoe inserts or orthotics. Occasionally surgery is beneficial.<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation: Peroneal Tendonitis</h2><br />Patients with peroneal tendonitis present with pain and, occasionally, swelling in the outside and back (posterolateral) part of the ankle (Figure 1). This tends to be a chronic condition, so there is often no precipitating event. However, sometimes patients will report an activity that aggravated their symptoms.<br /><h5>Figure 1: Location of pain and swelling in Peroneal Tendonitis</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/peroneal-tendonitis-figure-1.jpg">^media_display_589c29a9de9125bcb7693112/position:center^</a>The peroneal tendons run behind the prominent bone on the outside of the ankle. There are two tendons, the peroneus brevis and the peroneus longs. These tendons help to control the position of the foot during walking. They are also responsible for the muscle contraction that moves the foot out to the side (eversion of the foot). Peroneal tendonitis is an irritation to the peroneal tendons. Essentially, the tendons are repetitively overloaded and the subsequent inflammatory response (attempt at healing) creates pain and discomfort. This inflammatory response is the reason why patients with peroneal tendonitis often have startup pain, pain first thing in the morning. The mechanism by which peroneal tendonitis develops is akin to a rope that is repetitively overloaded. Just as a rope can become frayed- some patients with peroneal tendonitis will also have some tearing of the tendons. However, when tearing of the tendon occurs, it is usually in line with the tendon, essentially causing a split in the tendon. Patients with peroneal tendonitis are usually able to walk, although they may have a limp. When peroneal tendonitis is severe, it often prevents patients from participating in dynamic sporting type activities that require sudden changes of direction. At times, when a severe injury can dislocate the tendons out of their groove, they may go back on their own and heal, but at other times the tendons may keep coming out with certain maneuvers or activities, leading to chronic <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/subluxing-peroneal-tendons/">subluxing peroneal tendonitis</a>.</strong></em><br /><h2>Physical Examination: Peroneal Tendonitis</h2><br />Patients with peroneal tendonitis will often walk with a limp. Looking at the outside of the ankle, there may be some subtle (or not so subtle) swelling behind the lateral malleolus (the prominent bone on the outside of the ankle). Pressing on this area will often create discomfort. Many patients will have a <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/characteristics-of-high-arched-foot-subtle-cavus">higher arch foot</a></strong></em> (subtle cavus foot), with increased ankle inversion compared to eversion. This type of foot predisposes a patient to increased loads that the peroneal tendons have to bear during walking and running. In peroneal tendonitis, the patient’s sensation and muscle strength is usually normal.  However, there is a nerve (the sural nerve) that runs through the outside back part of the ankle, and this nerve may be irritated by the inflammation and swelling. This can lead to either decreased sensation or to a burning over the lateral or outside aspect of the foot. In rare instances, some patients may have a complete tear of one of the peroneal tendons, and in this situation there may be weakness in the ability to move the foot out to the side (eversion of the foot.). In patients with subluxing tendons, the tendons can be made to snap in and out of their grove.<br /><h2>Imaging Studies: Peroneal Tendonitis</h2><br />Plain weight-bearing x-rays are likely to show evidence of a <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/characteristics-of-high-arched-foot-subtle-cavus">higher arched foot </a></strong></em>pattern. However, the joints of the foot are usually normal, with no evidence of arthritis.An MRI is often ordered to determine if there is tearing of the peroneal tendons (Figure 2), and if there is tearing, to determine how extensive it is. It is common to see abnormal edema, representing the tendonitis in the peroneal tendons (Figure 3). It is also common to see a fair bit of increased fluid around the tendons. On both plain x-ray and particularly on MRI, it may be possible to identify the peroneal tubercle, which is occasionally very prominent or protruding and, at times, can serve as an irritant as the peroneal tendons run by this bony structure.<br /><h5><strong>Figure 2: MRI showing longitudinal tear of the peroneus brevis</strong></h5><br />^media_display_589c29aade9125bcb7693115/position:center^<br /><h5>Figure 3: MRI inflamed swollen peroneus longus and brevis tendons</h5><br />^media_display_589c29adde9125bcb7693118/position:center^<br /><h2>Treatment: Peroneal Tendonitis</h2><br /><h3>Non-Operative Treatment</h3><br />Patients with peroneal tendonitis, but no significant peroneal tendon tear, can usually be treated successfully non-operatively. Treatment is aimed at decreasing the load through the peroneal tendons and subsequently decreasing the inflammation. Successful non-operative treatment includes:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory-drugs-nsaids"><em>Anti-inflammatory medication</em></a></strong> to decrease inflammatory response from the tendons.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Ankle bracing</em>, such as the use of an <em><strong><a href="/ankle-lacers">ankle lacer</a></strong></em>, can be used to decrease the inversion moment in subsequent force going through the tendons.</li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/activity-modification"><em>Activity Modification</em></a></strong>: A short period of limited activity over a few weeks to allow the inflammatory response to settle can be very helpful.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Physical therapy</em> that works on gradually strengthening the peroneal tendons, as well as compromising the eversion motion, can also be helpful.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Avoid Precipitating Activities</em>: Certain activities will exacerbate peroneal tendonitis. These can include activities with sudden cutting or changing direction motions, or anything that will increase the force through the tendons. If these can be avoided, often the tendonitis symptoms will settle.</li><br /> 	<li><em>An <strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-foot-orthosis-afo">Orthotic</a></strong> with a recessed area under the first metatarsal head</em>: If a patient has a subtle or a not so <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/characteristics-of-high-arched-foot-subtle-cavus">subtle cavus (high arched)</a></strong></em> foot pattern, an orthotic with a recessed area under the first metatarsal head will often be beneficial. In patients with a high arched foot pattern, this type of orthotic can often partially or completely correct the hindfoot alignment, provided the hindfoot joints are still mobile. It would seem intuitive that patients with a high arched foot should have a high arch built into the inside of their orthotic, but in fact this is not recommended as it will have a tendency to tip the foot more to the outside, often exacerbating the load on the outside structures, such as the peroneal tendons.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Ice</em> applied to the area in 10- to 20-minute intervals can also be helpful in allowing some of the more acute symptoms to settle.</li><br /></ul><br /><h3>Operative Treatment</h3><br />In patients with a large peroneal tendon tear or a bony prominence that is serving as a physical irritant to the tendon, surgery may be beneficial. Physical irritants can include a prominent peroneal tubercle or a bone spur off of the back (posterior aspect) of the fibula (prominent bone on the outside of the ankle). Surgery is performed to: clean up the tendons themselves debridement or synovectomy); repair any significant tearing of the tendons; and if necessary smooth out the tract that the peroneal tendons run in. Often there is a tear of the peroneal tendon. If the longitudinal tearing represents less than 50% of the tendons, the torn part of the tendon is removed. If it is more than 50%, the tendon is debrided (cleaned up) and the involved tendon is sutured (transferred) to the other tendon.<br /><h3>Adjunctive Procedures</h3><br />Many patients may require other procedures in addition to the surgery on the peroneal tendons themselves, in order to address other related problems or alter the force that the peroneal tendons are subject to. These procedures may include:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em>Repair of the Peroneal Retinaculum: </em>In some individuals, the peroneal tendon problems will stem from the tendons partially (or completely) popping out of the groove (subluxing) that they normally run in, behind the fibula. This results from a tearing or stretching out of the superior peroneal retinaculum, which is a thick fibrous tissue that normally restrains the tendons. When this occurs, surgery to stabilize or repair the peroneal retinaculum may be necessary.</li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-arthroscopy"><em>Ankle arthroscopy</em></a></strong> <em>:</em> Patients with peroneal tendonitis may also have problems within the ankle joint itself. In this situation, an ankle arthroscopy may be indicated.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Peroneal tubercle resection: </em>The peroneal tubercle is a prominent bump of bone on the outside of the heel bone. It serves to seperate the two peroneal tendons (peroneus longus and peroneus brevis) as they run along the outside of the foot. This bump can become enlarged due to the irritation of the peroneal tendons, and in some patients it will reach a size where it may need to be removed.</li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/lateral-ankle-ligament-repair-reconstruction-brostrom-procedure">Ankle Ligament Stabilization</a></strong> (ex. Brostrum procedure)</em><em>: </em>Many patients with significant peroneal tendoinitis requiring surgery may also have ankle instability and may require a lateral ankle ligament stabilization, such as a Brostrum procedure, in addition to the procedures on the peroneal tendons.</li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/calcaneal-osteotomy"><em>Lateralizing Calcaneal Osteotomy</em></a></strong><em>: </em> In some individuals with significant alignment issues, it may be necessary to fundamentally change the shape of the hindfoot. This is typically done with a lateralizing calcaneal osteotomy. This allows the heel to be shifted, and the distribution of force to be more even over the hind part of the foot.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Peroneal tendon transfer and reconstruction:</em> At times, one of the peroneal tendons (usually the peroneus brevis) may have a tear or degeneration that is severe and prevents repair.  In this situation, the torn portion of the tendon is removed and the remaining part of the tendon is stitched on to the side of the intact tendon. If both tendons are damaged beyond repair, then if there is a functioning muscle after removing the damaged tendons, the gap in the tendon is reconstructed with a tendon taken form a donor (allograft tendon), or replaced with another tendon from the vicinity.</li><br /></ul><br /><h2>Potential Surgical Complications</h2><br />Potential complications of surgery can occur.

<h4>Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/jean-brilhault-md-editor" target="_blank">Jean Brilhaut, MD</a></strong></em></h4><br /><h2>Summary</h2><br />Plantar fasciitis is the most common cause of heel pain. Pain from plantar fasciitis is often most noticeable during the first few steps after getting out of bed in the morning. The plantar fascia is a thick band of tissue in the sole of the foot. Microtearing at the origin of the plantar fascia on the heel bone (calcaneus) can occur with repetitive loading. This microtearing leads to an inflammatory response (healing response) which produces the pain. Risk factors for plantar fasciitis include: excessive standing, increased body weight, increasing age, a change in activity level, and a stiff calf muscle. Plantar fasciitis can be managed non-operatively in the vast majority of patients. The main components of an effective non-operative treatment program are: calf stretching with the knee straight, plantar fascia stretching, activity modification (to avoid precipitating activities), and comfort shoe wear.<br /><h5>Figure 1: Common location of plantar fascia pain</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Plantar-Fasciitis-Figure-1.jpg">^media_display_589c29aede9125bcb769311c/position:center^</a><br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />Patients with plantar fasciitis almost universally give a history of pain with the first few steps in the morning. Pain is often also associated with first steps after periods of inactivity, such as sitting for lunch, or after getting out of a car. This pain is located in the heel and can be sharp (Figure 1). It will often improve after some movement or stretching. However, it will tend to recur as the day progresses, particularly if the patient has been doing significant weight-bearing activities, such as walking or standing. Burning pain is not typical of plantar fasciitis, and may suggest nerve irritation as a source of the pain (ex. Baxter’s neurtitis).Plantar Fasciitis is associated with:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li>Middle age</li><br /> 	<li>A recent increase in activity level (ex. new running program)</li><br /> 	<li>Jobs that require significant standing</li><br /> 	<li>Increased weight</li><br /> 	<li>Stiff calf muscles</li><br /></ul><br />Clinical examination will often localize the pain to the plantar medial heel region. Pain can also occur with direct pressure (palpation). There is often an associated stiffness (<em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/equinus-contractures">equinus contracture</a></strong></em>) of the calf demonstrated with the knee straight. Symptoms may also be exacerbated by placing the toes in a dorsiflexed position, thereby stretching the plantar fascia (See Figure 3). There is an association between <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/characteristics-of-flat-foot">flatfeet</a></strong></em> and the development of plantar fasciitis. However, any foot type can develop this condition.Plantar fasciitis is by far the most common cause of heel pain. However, there are other less common causes including:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/overload-heel-pain-syndrome">Overload heel pain syndrome</a></strong></em></li><br /> 	<li>Heel pad atrophy</li><br /> 	<li>Entrapment of the first branch of the lateral plantar nerve (Baxter’s nerve)</li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/tarsal-tunnel-syndrome">Tarsal tunnel syndrome</a></strong></em></li><br /> 	<li>Calcaneal stress fracture</li><br /> 	<li>Periosteal inflammation</li><br /> 	<li>Seronegative arthritis-induced inflammation</li><br /></ul><br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />Plantar fasciitis is typically diagnosed based on the patient’s history and on physical examination.  Plain x-rays are not routinely indicated. However, when ordered, a lateral, weight-bearing view of the foot will often demonstrate a calcaneal heel spur. Essentially, the same traction phenomena that causes overloading of the plantar fascia and its origin may cause excessive bone formation, in the form of a calcaneal heel spur. However, the presence of a heel spur does NOT directly correlate with symptoms. Many patients have heel spurs on x-rays and are asymptomatic, whereas, many patients have significant plantar fasciitis and do not demonstrate a heel spur on plain x-ray.MRI is initially not indicated for patients with heel pain that is believed to be secondary to plantar fasciitis.  However, if symptoms fail to resolve after a concerted treatment effort, an MRI may be ordered to rule out other causes of heel pain, such as a calcaneal stress fracture.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br /><h3>Non-Operative Treatment</h3><br />There is excellent non-operative treatment available for plantar fasciitis. The vast majority of patients will have their symptoms resolve with non-operative treatment. The main elements of non-operative treatment are as follows:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="/calf-stretch"><em>Calf Stretching</em></a></strong> (Figure 2): Regular daily calf stretching performed over a 6 to 8-week period will alleviate plantar fasciitis in almost 90% of patients. The stretching should be performed for a total of 3 minutes per day. It should be done with the knee straight so that the gastrocnemius is stretched, as this is the muscle that is tight. It should be performed on both sides. Six sets of 30 seconds per side is one method of achieving this. It is important that the stretch be done daily.</li><br /></ul><br /><h5>Figure 2: Calf stretch with back leg straight</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Plantar-Fasciitis-Figure-2.jpg">^media_display_589c29afde9125bcb769311f/position:center^</a><br /><ul><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="/plantar-fascia-specific-stretch"><em>Plantar Fascia Specific Stretch</em></a></strong> (Figure 3): Equally good results can be obtained with a formal plantar fascia stretch. Plantar fascia specific stretching has been found to provide symptomatic relief for the majority of patients. This is done in a seated position, and includes crossing the affected leg over the other leg. Using the hand on your affected side, take hold of your affected foot and pull your toes back towards your shin (Figure 3). This creates tension/stretch in the arch of the foot/plantar fascia. Check for the appropriate stretch position by gently rubbing the thumb of your unaffected side from left to right over the arch of the affected foot. The plantar fascia should feel firm, like a guitar string. The stretch position should be held for 10 seconds and repeated 10 times. The timing of when this is performed is important. It should be done prior to the first step in the morning and during the day before standing after prolonged inactivity. Most patients perform the stretch 4-5 times during the day for the first month, and then on a semi-regular basis (3-4 times per week). Decreased pain, with improvement of about 25-50% is expected at 6 weeks, with resolution of symptoms over 3-6 months.</li><br /></ul><br /><h5>Figure 3: Plantar Fascia Specific Stretch</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Plantar-Fasciitis-Figure-3.jpg">^media_display_589c29b0de9125bcb7693122/position:center^</a>With resolution of the heel pain symptoms, it is important to continue calf stretching and plantar fascia stretching on a semi-regular basis (3-4 times per week), so as to minimize the risk of recurrence. These treatment modalities treat the symptoms, but do not fully address the underlying biomechanical predisposing factors. Therefore, ongoing management of this condition is essential!<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/pre-fabricated-over-the-counter-orthotics-insert"><em>Over-the-counter Orthotics</em></a></strong><em>.</em> A soft, over-the-counter orthotic (Prefabricated orthotic) with an accommodating arch support has proven to be quite helpful in the management of plantar fascia symptoms. Studies demonstrate that it is NOT necessary to obtain a custom orthotic for the treatment of this problem.</li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/comfort-shoes"><em>Comfort Shoes</em></a></strong><em>.</em> Shoes with a stiff sole, a rocker-bottom contour, and a comfortable leather upper, combined with an over-the-counter orthotic or a padded heel can be very helpful in the treatment of plantar fasciitis.</li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory-drugs-nsaids"><em>Anti-Inflammatory Medication</em> (NSAIDs)</a></strong>: A short course of over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications may be helpful in managing plantar fasciitis symptoms, providing the patient does not have any contra-indications, such as a history of stomach ulcers.</li><br /> 	<li><strong><em><a href="/activity-modification">Activity Modification</a></em></strong> Any activity that has recently been started, such as a new running routine or a new exercise at the gym, that may have increased loading through the heel area, should be stopped on a temporary basis until the symptoms have resolved. At that point, these activities can be gradually started again. Also, any activity changes (ex. sitting more) that will limit the amount of time a patient is on their feet each day may be helpful.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Plantar Fascia Night Splint</em> (Figure 4): A night splint, which keeps the ankle in a neutral position (right angle) while the patient sleeps, can be very helpful in alleviating the significant morning symptoms. A night splint may be prescribed by your physician. Alternatively, it can be ordered online or even obtained in some medical supply stores. This splint is worn nightly for 1-3 weeks, until the cycle of pain is broken. Furthermore, this splinting can be reinstituted for a short period of time if symptoms recur.</li><br /></ul><br /><h5>Figure 4: Plantar fasciitis night splint</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Plantar-Fasciitis-Figure-4.jpg">^media_display_589c29b0de9125bcb7693125/position:center^</a><br /><ul><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/weight-loss"><em>Weight Loss</em></a></strong>: If the patient is carrying significant extra weight, losing weight can be very helpful in improving the symptoms associated with plantar fasciitis.  Essentially, anything that decreases the repetitive loading through the plantar fascia will help to alleviate the symptoms.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Local Injection</em>: For recalcitrant plantar fasciitis, some physicians will recommend a local injection of corticosteroids. This can be helpful in breaking the cycle of pain. Some physicians have advocated using <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/prp-plasma-rich-protein-injections">PRP (Plasma-Rich Protein) injections</a></strong></em> to treat recalcitrant plantar fasciitis. Unfortunately, these injections can be uncomfortable. There is also a very slight chance that they may lead to an infection. Furthermore, injections will not change the underlying biomechanics, so they typically need to be combined with the stretching protocols that have been previously described.</li><br /></ul><br /><h3>Operative Treatment</h3><br />About 90% of patients will respond to appropriate non-operative treatment measures over a period of 3-6 months. Surgery is a treatment option for patients with persistent symptoms, but is NOT recommended unless a patient has failed a minimum of 6-9 months of appropriate non-operative treatment. There are a number of reasons why surgery is not immediately entertained, including:<br /><ol><br /> 	<li>Non-operative treatment when performed appropriately has a high rate of success.</li><br /> 	<li>Recovery from any foot surgery often takes longer than patients expect</li><br /> 	<li>Complications following this type of surgery can and DO occur</li><br /> 	<li>The surgery often does not fully address the underlying reason why the condition occurred, and therefore the surgery may not be completely effective.</li><br /> 	<li>Prior to surgical intervention, it is important that the treating physician ensure that the correct diagnosis has been made. This seems self-evident, but there are other potential causes of heel pain.</li><br /></ol><br />Surgical intervention may include extracorporeal shock wave therapy or endoscopic or open partial plantar fasciectomy.<em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/foot-and-ankle-physical-therapy/extracorporeal-shockwave-therapy-eswt-for-treatment-of-plantar-fasciitis/">Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy</a></strong> (High Energy)</em>: This is often performed under anesthesia. High-intensity shock waves are focused on the plantar fascia insertion. This creates a controlled injury to the plantar fascia. With the new blood supply entering this area as a healing response, the symptoms are often improved. There is a propensity for symptoms to gradually recur, although reasonable results have been reported at 6month and 2-year follow-ups.<em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/endoscopic-partial-plantar-fasciotomy">Partial Plantar Fasciectomy</a></strong>:</em> This involves removal of the injured area of the plantar fascia, either endoscopically or through the small incision.  This is then followed by a 6-week period of relative rest and stretching.  Although this procedure has produced good results, it can increase the risk of a rupture of the plantar fascia, with resulting profound flatfoot deformity and an increase in symptoms.<strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/gastrocnemius-slide-strayer-procedure"><em>Gastrocnemius recession</em></a></strong> <em>(a.k.a. Strayer or Volpious procedure):</em> Recently, there have been a few studies which suggest that lengthening the calf muscle (gastrocnemius) can help resolve the symptoms associated with plantar fasciitis.  This operation involves making an incision in the lower calf, in order to release the tendon of the gastrocnemius at the point where it inserts just above the Achilles tendon. Following the surgery, patients need a six week period of relative rest.  The calf muscle can have noticeable residual weakness that usually resolves in 6-12 months.  At this time, there are only limited studies assessing the long-term effectiveness of this procedure.<br /><h3><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/07-19-2014-Plantar-Fasciitis-Handout.pdf">Click Her</a>e for a Summary Handout on Plantar Fasciitis</h3><br /><p>Edited on November 8, 2016</p>

Dellenbaugh, MD</a></strong></em><br /><h2>Summary</h2><br />The primary symptom described by patients with the terrible triad of posterior heel pain is pain in the back part of their heel (Figure 1). The terrible triad includes:<br /><ol><br /> 	<li>Insertional Achilles tendonitis</li><br /> 	<li>Retrocalcaneal bursitis</li><br /> 	<li>A Haglund’s deformity</li><br /></ol><br />Patients may also have swelling that is quite tender to the touch. Standing, walking, and constrictive shoes typically aggravate symptoms. Many patients with this problem are middle-aged and some may be slightly overweight. Another group of patients who suffer from this condition are young, active runners.<br /><h5>Figure 1: Location of Posterior Heel Pain</h5><br />^media_display_589c29b1de9125bcb7693129/position:center^<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation: Insertional Achilles Tendonitis</h2><br /><h3>Haglund's Deformity</h3><br />Haglund's deformity is the bony prominence associated with the upper part of the heel bone (calcaneus).  This prominent bone tends to form gradually over many years, and can eventually cause irritation by disrupting nearby structures.<br /><h3>Retrocalcaneal Bursitis</h3><br />Wherever tissues rub against one another, a bursa forms to allow for smooth gliding of tissues. A bursa is a sac filled with lubricating fluid, which occurs normally throughout the body. Although it is only a few cell layers thick, when irritated, a bursa can become markedly thickened and painful. This is often referred to as bursitis.The retrocalcaneal bursa is positioned to allow the Achilles tendon to glide over the back part (posterior aspect) of the heel bone. When this bone becomes enlarged, inflammation of the retrocalcaneal bursa occurs. This inflammation results in exquisite tenderness along the posterior aspect of the heel and can result in a prominence called a &quot;pump bump.&quot;<br /><h3>Insertional Achilles Tendonitis</h3><br />The Achilles tendon connects the calf muscle to the heel bone. As the strongest and largest tendon in the body, the Achilles tendon is regularly subjected to forces that are 2-4 times greater than a person’s body weight. The forces are even stronger during athletic participation, which means the Achilles bears an immense amount of stress on a regular basis. Over time, these repetitive loads can lead to degenerative wear and tear, specifically where the tendon inserts into the heel bone (calcaneus). This degeneration incites an inflammatory response and produces pain at the back of the heel. Eventually, the inflamed Achilles tendon may become calcified, forming bone-like fragments in the tendon.<br /><h2>History</h2><br />Patients with posterior heel pain due to the terrible triad report tenderness over the back of the heel where the Achilles tendon inserts into the heel bone. The symptoms often come on gradually, although a sudden increase in activity level may start the symptoms.  Patients experience swelling, and they may note a bump that is most irritated with tight fitting shoes. Running may aggravate the symptoms.<br /><h2>Physical Examination</h2><br />There is tenderness and swelling on palpation of the heel when compared to the other side. Redness is occasionally present. Patients may walk with a limp or have may have difficulty taking a full stride. In long standing cases, the tendon lengthens and a single leg heel rise becomes difficult.<br /><h2>Treatment of Posterior Heel Pain due to Insertional Achilles Tendonitis</h2><br /><h3>Non-Operative Treatment</h3><br />Initial treatment for posterior heel pain starts with non-operative treatment. Traditional non-operative treatment includes the following:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em>Heel Lift or the Use of a Shoe with a Moderate Heel</em>: Walking barefoot, or in a flat-soled shoe, increases the tension on the insertion of the Achilles tendon. Using a heel lift or a shoe with a moderate heel can help both reduce the stress on the tendon, and decrease the irritation caused by this condition.</li><br /></ul><br /><h5>Figure 2: Heel Lifts</h5><br />^media_display_589c29b2de9125bcb769312c/position:center^<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><strong><em><a href="/calf-stretch">Calf Stretching</a></em></strong>: Regular calf stretching can help improve the compliance and length of the Achilles tendon. This makes it more resilient to wear and tear due to the repetitive loading associated with standing and walking.</li><br /> 	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/non-operative-treatment/non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory-drugs-nsaids/"><em><strong>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories [NSAIDs]</strong></em></a> may help manage symptoms, but these medications do not address the actual underlying pathology. They work by limiting the body’s inflammatory response, and decrease the heel pain. If a patient has a history of stomach problems, such as an ulcer or heartburn, NSAIDs should be avoided or precautions taken. Recent data show an elevated of risk of cardiovascular disease with prolonged use of these medications.</li><br /> 	<li><strong><em><a href="/weight-loss">Weight Loss</a></em></strong>: Many patients with posterior heel pain are overweight. A concerted effort to lose substantial weight may be one of the most effective ways to manage this condition. The Achilles tendon is often subjected to forces equivalent to many times a person’s body weight during regular, daily activities (i.e. walking and standing).  Therefore, losing weight (even as little as 5-10 pounds) can be very helpful.</li><br /> 	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/cam-walker-walking-boot"><strong><em>Cast or Walker boot</em></strong></a>: Wearing a removable fracture walker boot for 4-8 weeks may permit healing of the degenerative tendon tearing. This is often successful initially, but if the cause of the microscopic tendon tearing is not addressed, the symtpoms may recur.</li><br /></ul><br /><h3>Operative Treatment</h3><br />Due to the lengthy recovery associated with surgery, along with the relatively unpredictable postoperative outcome, non-operative management should be exhausted before surgery is contemplated. However, in high-level athletes that have developed Haglund's deformity from running, surgery may be indicated. Surgery usually involves:<br /><ol><br /> 	<li>Removing the prominent excess bone associated with the Haglund's deformity.</li><br /> 	<li>Removing the thickened inflamed retrocalcaneal bursa.</li><br /> 	<li>&quot;Cleaning up&quot; (debriding) the Achilles tendon. In some patients where there is excessive degeneration of the tendon, it is necessary to partially or completely remove the tendon and then reattach it.  In these instances, it may be necessary to augment or even replace the completely degenerative Achilles tendon with another tendon, such as the<a href="http://www.footeducation.com/flexor-hallucis-longus-fhl-tendon-transfer-to-the-achilles-tendon"> big toe tendon</a> (flexor hallucis longus).</li><br /></ol><br /><span style="color: #3a3a3a; line-height: 25.5px; font-family: 'Open Sans',sans-serif; font-size: 17px;">Recovery from surgery is prolonged. Initially, the leg is immobilized to allow the wound to heal. Then gentle range of motion exercises can be started. Patients are protected from full weight-bearing for the first six weeks while the tendon heals to the bone. Gradually, with physical therapy, full weight bearing and return to activity can be expected. Improvement in strength continues for several months and may take over one year. The recovery is quicker in younger, athletic patients.</span><br /><h2>Potential Complications</h2><br /><h3>Specific Complications</h3><br /><span style="color: #3a3a3a; line-height: 25.5px; font-family: 'Open Sans',sans-serif; font-size: 17px;">Complications that are specific to this surgery include the potential for partial or complete rupture of the Achilles tendon where it attaches (inserts) into the heel bone (calcaneus). . Infection in the area of the Achilles tendon, although relatively uncommon, is a very serious problem due to the limited skin and soft-tissue coverage in this area.</span><br /><h3>General Complications</h3><br /><ul><br /> 	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications"><em><strong>Wound infection</strong></em>.</a></li><br /> 	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications"><em><strong>Wound breakdown</strong></em>.</a></li><br /> 	<li>Injury to the sural nerve.</li><br /> 	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications"><em><strong>Deep vein thrombosis [DVT]</strong></em>.</a></li><br /> 	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications"><em><strong>Pulmonary embolism [PE]</strong></em>.</a></li><br /> 	<li>Gait asymmetry leading to low back pain or other symptoms.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>Edited November 13, 2016</p><br /><p>(Previously edited by <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/lance-silverman-md-editor/">Lance Silverman MD</a>, <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/timothy-charlton-md-editor/">Tim Charlton MD</a>)</p>
Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/gwyneth-devries-md-frcsc-editor" target="_blank">Gwyneth Price, MD</a></strong></em><br /><h2>Summary</h2><br />Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune condition that affects the joints and causes swelling of the joint lining (synovium). Though this condition can involve any joint, it most commonly affects the small joints of the hands and feet. For example, RA can occur in the <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/rheumatoid-arthritis-of-forefoot">hindfoot </a></strong></em>or <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/rheumatoid-hindfoot-arthritis/">forefoot</a></strong></em>. Rheumatoid Arthritis is a condition that often requires the specialized care of a rheumatologist.  It is unknown how one develops this condition, but research is currently being done on the subject.  Family history often plays a role and it has been suggested that climate may also be a factor.  Rheumatoid Arthritis is more common in women in their thirties and forties, and symptoms tend to increase with age.  Some patients are referred for surgery in addition to other treatments.<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />RA is characterized by a swollen, painful, and warm joint (or joints).  This condition typically affects multiple joints in the body. Symptoms tend to appear gradually, making it a difficult condition to diagnose. There are some blood tests that can help a rheumatologist determine the presence of the condition in a patient. A low blood level (anemia), positive rheumatoid factor, and a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate can be signs that a patient has RA.  With RA, a patient typically undergoes painful flare-ups rather than having continuous pain. These flare-ups tend to be acute and come and go in waves, (one flare can occur, with another flare-up not occurring for months after).  Although the flare-ups themselves are of concern, the damage that they cause to the joints are also problematic. Arthritic symptoms tend to present in the joints that have sustained cartilage damage from a RA flare-up. Even if the condition is completely managed, the damage from the flare-up must still be addressed.<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />X-rays can be helpful in diagnosing RA. Indents at the edge of the joint (peri-articular erosions) are a classic x-ray finding in patients with RA.  This is characterized by the erosion of bone at the origination of a joint capsule. X-rays are also very useful for determining deformity, and/or loss of cartilage that can eventually occur at the most affected joints.  Rheumatoid nodules can also appear with RA, which are best visualized with an MRI.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br /><h3>Non-Operative Treatment</h3><br />There is presently no cure for RA. Therefore, treatment of the condition is based on controlling the disease. As the medical profession has developed a better understanding of RA, a more aggressive approach to treatment has become popular. There are now a series of potentially helpful treatment options available for patients with RA. Anti-inflammatory medications and injections are available, in addition to disease modifying agents such as methotrexate and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors (Humera, Enbrel, Remicade, etc).  The goal of the treating rheumatologist is to get the condition under control and keep it under control – thereby minimizing the cartilage damage that can occur with RA. There is a wide range in how extensive the rheumatoid arthritic involvement can be for each patient. Each patient requires a specialized treatment plan to control his or her disease.  Some patients require constant medication, while others only need to be on it occasionally.  Aggressive treatment of flare-ups should be done to prevent permanent damage to the involved joints.In the case of flare ups of the foot and ankle, considerable relief can be gained from the use of appropriate footwear and insoles. The affected joints can be supported and kept more comfortable, but this does not take the place of the medical management described above. Certified pedorthists are experts in shoe fitting and customizations, and are familiar with the problems resulting from RA.  When toe deformities are the main issue, a <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/comfort-shoes">comfort shoe</a> </strong></em> characterized by a wide, deep toebox is usually very helpful.  An orthotic and/or a rocker soled shoe can support RA involvement of the midfoot (arch) and ankle. Some patients may benefit from the use of <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-taping">ankle bracing</a></strong></em> or even the use of a removable walking<em><strong> <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/cam-walker-walking-boot">cast boot</a>.</strong></em><br /><h3>Operative Treatment</h3><br />Patients with foot and ankle deformities and/or cartilage loss secondary to RA may require reconstructive surgery.  Surgery, if indicated, is performed to address a specific problem that the RA has caused, such as clawing of the toes, or loss of cartilage (arthritis) of a specific joint (ex. subtalar, talonavicular, or ankle joint).  Fusion of joints that have extensive arthritis may be very effective. Sometimes smaller procedures, such as removing painful lumps associated with RA, (rheumatoid nodules) can be helpful.For some RA patients that have extensive arthritis involving the ankle joint, a definitive procedure such as an<em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-fusion-arthrodesis"> ankle fusion</a></strong></em> or an <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-replacement">ankle replacement</a></strong></em> may be beneficial.Prior to any surgery, the surgeon and rheumatologist will review RA medications. It may be important to temporarily stop taking certain medications while recovering from surgery.  Medications such as TNF inhibitors tend to suppress the immune system, and may increase the risk of a post-operative infection.<br /><p align="right">Edited on November 8, 2016</p><br />

When rheumatoid disease affects this joint, it leads to an inflammatory-type arthritis which can affect the TN joint and other joints of the hindfoot, midfoot, or forefoot.<br /><h2>Physical Exam and Symptoms</h2><br />On routine physical exam, motion is often severely limited through the hindfoot, particularly when assessing side-to-side (inversion-eversion) or rotational movement.. There may also be swelling or bogginess in the foot just below the anterior aspect of the ankle along the medial side. Patients will frequently have direct tenderness to palpation along the top (dorsal) and inside (medial) aspect of the midfoot. Other hindfoot joints may also be affected by the rheumatoid arthritis, in which case tenderness and pain may also be present on the outside (lateral) aspect to the hindfoot.<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />X-rays are helpful in diagnosing this condition. Diffuse, often symmetrically erosive arthritic changes will usually be noted through the talonavicular joint (Figure 1). Sometimes, the affected joint “disappears” or autofuses. This can increase motion on nearby joints and can also result in pain. The narrowing that occurs in the joint can also be associated with decreased bone density (osteopenia) of the surrounding bones.<br /><h5>Figure 1: Normal vs Arthritic Talonavicular Joint</h5><br /><strong>^media_display_589c29b3de9125bcb7693131/position:center^</strong><br /><h2>Lab Tests</h2><br />Patients suffering from RA or related rheumatological disorders will generally exhibit abnormal lab values on blood tests, such as a positive “rheumatoid factor.” Seeking out the results of such labwork may help confirm the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis if it is in question.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br /><h3>Non-Operative Treatment</h3><br /><ul><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="/comfort-shoes"><em>Comfort shoes</em></a></strong> can be helpful in the treatment of this condition.

Success of this procedure requires that the bone ends heal together. When a successful fusion is obtained it is typically a very effective and durable pain relieving procedure. The procedure does, however, restrict future motion from that joint and this can make the foot somewhat stiffer—but few patients consider this an issue given the excellent long term pain relief that can be expected from this operation. A bone graft procedure is often done in conjunction with this procedure to increase the fusion rate (decrease the rate of non-union), even though rates of fusion without bone grafting are still quite high. Sometimes it may also be necessary to fuse adjacent joints to improve surgical outcomes (e.g. subtalar, calcaneocuboid or cuneiform-navicular joint). The fusion procedure eliminates RA as a disease process in THAT particular joint—but does not eliminate the systemic disease process itself nor does it relieve RA as a disease process in any of the other non-operated joints. Additionally, bone quality in patients who have RA can often be diminished (osteopenia), and this may require perioperative pharmacological management to maximize the bony healing response.<br /><h3>Recovery</h3><br />Generally speaking, the routine post-operative setting mandates a minimum of 6-12 weeks in a short leg cast to allow the bones to have the best chance of healing. Patients are usually started in a non-weightbearing setting and gradually advanced to partial and then ultimately to full weightbearing over the course of this recovery. Following cast removal, patients can begin graduated walking in a removable boot, such as a CAM walker. At this point, physical therapy should begin, with an emphasis on strengthening, edema control, improving the range of motion (ROM) of the other non-fused joints, and gait retraining.  Patients are often dramatically better by 12 weeks postoperatively, although it will generally takes upwards of one year to reach the point of maximal recovery.<br /><h2>Complications</h2><br />In addition to the most common <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications/">orthopaedic surgical complications</a> listed elsewhere on this website, there are certain complications which can be considered more specific to talonavicular fusion surgery. Although still quite unusual, non-union is the most common of these, due to the poor blood supply in that region and the amount of force applied to that area when walking. Another fairly rare but non insignificant complication associated with surgery being performed on patients who have RA can be soft tissue problems such as wound healing or infection, because patients who have RA may have poor soft tissues and/or are often immunocompromised from having taken multiple anti-rheumatoid drugs over time to control the systemic disease.<br /><p>Edited November 8, 2016, (Previously edited by <strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/mark-perry-md/">Mark Perry, MD</a></strong>)</p><br /><p></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><br />One of the most common ways that RA is initially diagnosed is due to a problem in the foot.  There is a large spectrum of problems associated with RA in the forefoot.  There is often a classic presentation of a rheumatoid deformity. Although the RA may be under control, the patient still must deal with any resulting deformities.<br /><h4>Clinical Presentation</h4><br />There are multiple deformities associated with RA.  These include a bunion deformity with arthritis of the first MTP joint, clawing of all the lesser toes, and subluxation or dislocation of the lesser MTP joints.  Patients with clawed toes that result in dislocation often complain of feeling like they are walking on a pebble.  This is due to a prominent metatarsal head on the plantar side of the foot.  Obvious deformities and their associated pain are usually obvious upon physical examination.<br /><h4>Imaging Studies</h4><br />Although a diagnosis can often be made clinically, x-rays may be helpful to help confirm the extent of the pathology.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br /><h4>Non-Operative Treatment</h4><br />The goal of non-operative treatment is to make the deformed part of the foot as comfortable as possible.  Comfort shoe wear can be extremely helpful in managing the pain associated with a RA deformity.  Inserts that are custom made or bought over the counter can be used to help offload the prominent area.  Additionally, corn pads or basic padding can be used to protect bony prominences.  There are also devices available to help improve claw toe position.Activity modification can also be helpful in managing pain due to RA in the forefoot.  In some instances, physical therapy or a stretching program may be recommended in order to help maintain joint mobility.  Most importantly, the RA itself must be managed to prevent further damage and deformations.<br /><h4>Operative Treatment</h4><br />Operative treatment must be appropriate to the patient's condition.  For mild to moderate deformations, procedures to correct claw toes can be very helpful. For moderate to severe forefoot deformities, the surgical options vary.  For a bunion deformity, it is common for the great toe to be straightened and the first MTP joint to be fused. This procedure greatly reduces the pain in the great toe. If the MTP joint is well preserved, then the patient may be able to undergo a basic bunion correction surgery.The various toe deformities caused by RA in the forefoot can be addressed in different ways.  A standard Clayton-Hoffmann procedure, which involves a resection of all of the lesser metatarsal heads with an associated correction of the claw toes, can be very effective for pain relief of the forefoot.  While this lessens the pain, it does not address the dysfunction of the foot.  With this procedure, the toes will no longer be able to articulate, greatly limiting a patient's activity.  If a joint is not yet dislocated and has reasonably well preserved cartilage, it may be possible to preserve the MTP joints by reducing the subluxed joint and correcting the claw toes. This procedure will not be as successful if the joint already has marked arthritis. Additionally, treatment of each claw toe can be individualized.<br /><h4>Recovery</h4><br />Although specific recovery directions will accompany each procedure, in most cases weight bearing will be limited for the first six weeks. Following the initial six weeks, a gradual increase of activity can be made and physical therapy will generally be prescribed.Relief is usually noticeable by the 6th week and about 80% of recovery can be expected by three months. It is important to keep in mind that it can take 9-12 months to reach a point of maximal improvement.<br /><h4>Complications</h4><br />Common surgical complications are applicable to any of these procedures. More specifically, blood supply to the tip of the toe can be compromised with the previously mentioned procedures.  RA medication must be stopped 2-6 weeks prior to any surgical procedure, which can increase the chance of infection and wound healing problems. Blood clots, pulmonary embolism, persistence of symptoms, and recurrence of deformity are also possible with any of these procedures.
Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/christopher-w-digiovanni-md-editor" target="_blank">Chris DiGiovanni, MD</a></strong></em><br /><h2>Summary</h2><br />Pain on the bottom of the foot at the base of the great toe is characteristic of sesamoiditis.  Symptoms usually originate from excessive, repetitive loading to this area of the foot.  Often patients will have a higher arched foot.  Treatment involves avoiding activities that aggravate symptoms; inserts that offload the involved area, comfort shoes, anti-inflammatory medications if tolerated, and possibly corticosteroid injections.  Patience is required as it often takes time to successfully manage the symptoms of sesamoiditis.<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />Sesamoiditis is characterized by pain on the bottom of the foot along the base of the great toe.  Sesamoiditis is a general term for painful inflammatory symptoms associated with either one or both of the sesamoid bones, which are located beneath the first metatarsal head as it forms part of the great toe.  Symptoms can originate from a variety of pathologies that affect the sesamoid bones, but discomfort is usually associated with excessive loading of this area of the foot.  Patients who present with this problem will often have a history of some recent event or series of events which resulted in increased stress to this area.  They often describe a recent increase in repetitive weight-bearing activities that suddenly overload this joint, and a large percentage of these patients will recall ramping up some form of athletics, a sudden change in shoe wear, an increased exercise or training regimen, or, especially, an increase in their running training when queried in the physician’s office.  Rarely is a major acute traumatic event the cause for the problem, although it certainly can be.  Usually these patients have unwittingly subjected themselves to gradually increased or changed activity levels.  Pain from this area is usually described as sharp and severe at times, and most patients can pinpoint the location with one finger (ie, the sesamoid itself).  The discomfort they experience often leads to a restriction of activities, changes in shoe wear, and possibly even a limp.  Patients will often find it uncomfortable to walk with barefeet or on hard surfaces.  The actual symptoms can stem from a variety of causes, including:  local overload of the soft-tissues in this area with resulting chronic tissue injury, <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/sesamoid-stress-fractures/">stress fracture of one of the sesamoids</a></strong></em> or a sesamoid which never heals (nonunion) after injury, and cartilage damage (arthritis) between the sesamoid and the first metatarsal head.  Another common injury to the great toe area is a “<em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/turf-toe">turf toe</a></strong></em>&quot; injury, which is usually identified after acute trauma, and can also present with pain on the bottom of the ball of the foot beneath the big toe.<br /><h2>Physical Examination</h2><br />The most common forms of sesamoiditis, by far, present with a slow, steady onset of patterned pain beneath an otherwise normal looking big toe, which is worse with weightbearing and better with offloading activity.  Patients can almost always point right to the site of discomfort, which is directly beneath one, or both, of the sesamoids.  These structures sit on the inside (medial) and outside (lateral) part of the base of the great toe (1st metatarsophalangeal joint, beneath the 1st metatarsal head) —which these bones are designed to support.  Patients are typically tender to palpation directly beneath one or both of the sesamoids, at the plantar base of the big toe.It is also common for patients who suffer from sesamoiditis to have high arched feet, since this type of foot predisposes to this problem by concentrating excess load underneath the great toe, along the ball of the foot.  Range of motion of the great toe is often normal, although there may be pain at the extremes of motion, particularly when the toe is bent upwards (dorsiflexed), because this puts axial strain on the tissues that attach to the sesamoids below.  Marked loss of motion of the big toe, or pain on the top of the great toe is more consistent with a diagnosis of <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/hallux-rigidus-hallux-limitus">hallux rigidus</a></strong></em> and progressive arthritis.<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />Plain x-rays of the foot are always indicated to both help diagnose this problem, as well as rule out other potential problems in this region of the foot.  They permit proper assessment of the entire forefoot region, and, in particular, are designed to look at the two sesamoids and how they sit anatomically beneath the great toe joint (1st metatarsophalangeal joint).  Fractures, subluxations, dislocations, osteochondrosis, or avascular necrosis affecting the sesamoid(s) can usually be diagnosed on these plain x-rays. Sometimes people are born with sesamoids that are naturally in several pieces, called bipartite (two pieces) or multipartite (many pieces) sesamoids.  While the normal sesamoid is a singular roundish bone the size of a pea, these types almost look like the bone has been broken.  They are simply a normal variant, however, and need to be carefully distinguished from true fractures.   Bipartite or multipartite sesamoids are common and, while they can cause pain in certain circumstances, they are usually asymptomatic.  The best way to make this diagnosis is to get x-rays of the opposite side, since bipartite sesamoids are often bilateral whereas a true fracture is usually not.When an accurate diagnosis cannot be made and certain possible problems still cannot be ruled out, an MRI or even a CT scan can usually accurately differentiate between these various pathologies.  MRI is probably the most preferred test, but both can be very helpful and may need to be ordered in order to assess whether there is evidence of joint damage (ex. arthritis) in the great toe, a capsular injury (<em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/turf-toe/">turf toe</a></strong></em>), an areas of dead bone (avascular disease or osteochondrosis), or a <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/sesamoid-stress-fractures/"><em><strong>stress fracture of one of the sesamoids</strong></em></a>.<br /><h2 align="left">Treatment</h2><br />While sesamoiditis can be a chronic, aggravating condition that is recalcitrant to treatment, fortunately most cases can be effectively treated with various forms of offloading and inflammation control. Management first requires ensuring that the symptoms are not caused by a fracture or nonunion of the sesamoid, or by an injury to the joint capsule of the great toe known as <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/turf-toe">turf toe</a></strong></em>, however, since these conditions are usually treated somewhat differently and often respond differently to care.  Straightforward cases of uncomplicated sesamoiditis are typically treated by off-loading the area, modifying activities in the short-term to decrease repetitive injury to the sesamoids, and possibly taking anti-inflammatory medication or icing to improve symptoms.  Specific treatments include:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/activity-modification"><em>Activity modification</em></a></strong>: Symptoms are often precipitated by an increase in activity level, a change in shoewear, or a change in impact activity - anything that serves to increase the force and/or repetition of loading to that area of the foot.  Stopping any precipitating activity (stress) is a key first step to managing the symptoms of sesamoiditis.  Decreasing activity level or modifying activities to dramatically decrease the loading to this area of the foot is an important short-term solution to allow the chronically injured tissue in the foot to have a chance to heal.  After symptoms have settled and other treatments have been instituted, activity level can often (but not always) be very gradually resumed.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Off-loading shoe inserts</em>: A shoe insert designed to cushion and offload the area under the base of the great toe can be very helpful.  This can be done by either using a cushioning insert and adding a &quot;Dancer's pad&quot; to take load away from the involved area, or by using a customized or over the counter prefabricated orthotic with a recessed area under the base of the great to, so that this area is taking less force with each step than it normally does.</li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/comfort-shoes"><em>Comfortable, well padded, supportive shoe wear</em></a></strong> : Shoes that disperse forces evenly away from the front of the foot can be helpful.  Typically shoes with a stiff but supportive sole and a slight rolling curve to the sole (rocker-bottom contour) will be helpful.  It is important to combine any rocker sole with a soft or contoured insert/orthotic, however, as the use of simply a stiff sole alone can actually aggravate symptoms.</li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory-drugs-nsaids"><em>Anti-Inflammatory Medications (NSAIDs)</em></a></strong>: In patients who do not have any contra-indication, the use of anti-inflammatory medications may help provide excellent short-term pain relief.  It is important to realize that NSAIDs address the pain response, but often do not address the underlying reason leading to the pain (repetitive localized loading)</li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/corticosteroid-injections"><em>Injection Therapy or Surgery</em></a></strong>:  Occasionally, when the aforementioned treatment strategies fail, patients can be considered as potential candidates for a steroid injection.  This, however, should not be considered as part of the standard or typically necessary treatment regimen for this problem, and should be reserved for extremely recalcitrant cases.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Surgery</em>:  Various forms of surgery to offload the sesamoid can also be considered in extenuating circumstances, such as with patients who present with anatomical mechanical overload as a result of high arched feet.  Surgery too, however, remains a rare requirement to treat the majority of these patients.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>Edited on December 7, 2016</p>
<h2>Summary</h2><br /><p class="summary">Patients with shins splints will experience pain at the front of their shins. Symptoms may be worse after certain activities or following prolonged rest (ex. getting out of bed in the morning). Symptoms are often precipitated by an increase in activity level. Treatment often involves rest, icing, anti-inflammatory medication, gentle stretching, and activity modification.</p><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />Pain at the front of the shin (tibia) is a key feature of &quot;shin splints&quot;. This pain is typically located over a broad area of the lower inside (medial) aspect of the shin. Shins splints are often associated with a history of an increase in activities, such as extra walking on a hard surface, a new training regiment, or a long hike. Pain may initially improve with activity. However, with prolonged activities, symptoms will be worsened. Start-up pain (pain first thing in the morning or after prolonged sitting) is common.Shin splints occur when the attachment of the muscles originating from the large lower leg bone (tibia) become irritated. The attachment on the outer layer of the bone site (the periosteum) becomes inflamed (periosteitis), due to the repetitive traction of the muscles pulling on it. The muscles involved are the muscles of the &quot;anterior compartment&quot; and include the tibitalis anterior, the extensor hallucis longus (pulls the big toe up), and the extensor digitorum longus (pulls the smaller toes up). In some patients, one of the muscles (the tibialis posterior) attaching on the inside and back part of the lower leg bone (tibia) may create symptoms.Shin splints need to be differentiated from a stress fracture of the tibia, which is a microscopic fracture involving the tibia bone itself. Generally, a stress fracture creates more localized pain than shins splints, although sometimes imaging studies are required to differentiate the two conditions.<br /><h2>Physical Examination</h2><br />Generalized tenderness along the shin is a common finding on examination. Occasionally, there will be swelling or even redness noted in the front of the shins. In addition, many patients will have a tight calf muscle as this will increase the traction forces of the muscle pulling on the front of the bone (tibia).<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />X-rays of the lower leg bones (Tibia and Fibula) may be indicated to rule out any obvious stress fracture. However, in most instances these x-rays will be negative.Occasionally, an MRI may be ordered to help rule out a stress fracture. Often there will be a localized area of edema (characteristic of increased blood flow) where the muscle attaches to the bone. In patients with stress fractures of the tibia, a localized area of edema in the bone itself will be seen.Often a &quot;bone scan&quot; will be ordered instead of an MRI to help establish the diagnosis. A bone scan involves injecting blood that has been tagged with low level radioactive tracers. A bone scan will &quot;light up&quot; in areas where there is a high blood flow. In patients with shin splints, there will be a generally low-level increase in activity that is seen on the bone scan. This differs from a stress fracture of the tibia that will have a very localized high-intensity area of involvement on the bone scan.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br />Once a diagnosis of shin splints has been made, treatment involves a healing phase to let the symptoms settle, followed by a rehabilitation phase to build the area back up and minimize the risk of recurrence.<br /><h3>Healing Phase Treatment:</h3><br /><h4><em>Relative Rest</em></h4><br />All precipitating activities should be stopped, and patients should limit their walking and running until the symptoms settle. This condition is essentially caused by repetitive microscopic trauma to the muscles where they insert into the bone. Stopping the inciting activity to allow the body's healing to catch up is a critical component of treating shin splints. Relatively non-weight bearing activities, such as swimming and cycling, may be substituted at this stage.<br /><h4><em>Icing</em></h4><br />Applying ice to the front of the shin in 10-15 minute intervals can help improve symptoms and decrease the body's inflammatory response.<br /><h4><em>Gentle stretching</em></h4><br />Gently stretching the muscles at the front of the lower leg (anterior compartment muscles) by pointing the foot downwards should be done for 30-60 seconds at a time, repeated 4-5 times and then again 2-4 times per day. In addition, gentle calf stretching is likely to be helpful.<br /><h4><em>Anti-inflammatory medications</em></h4><br />A short course of anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) can significantly help with symptoms. However, they should not be used to mask the symptoms (i.e. increase the amount of training that can be done), as this can cause the conditions to become more chronic.<br /><h3>Rehabilitation Phase</h3><br />After symptoms have settled, patients should begin a rehabilitation phase designed to gradually return them to their desired activity level. Shin splints have a tendency to recur, so some element of regular ongoing preventative treatment is often required to keep the symptoms of shin splints from recurring.<br /><h4><em>Continued stretching</em></h4><br />Stretching the lower leg muscle is an important component of controlling the symptoms associated with shin splints.<br /><h4><em>Heat</em></h4><br />Heat applied to the shins may help, particularly in the warm-up phase prior to starting a workout.<br /><h4><em>Calf support stocking (Shin Splint compression sleeve)</em></h4><br />Consider trying a calf support stocking. This device applies gentle compression to the muscles of the lower leg and may help to dampen the forces that muscles exert to the bone. In addition, they will help retain heat in the area. This device may not be for everyone, but is probably worth a try for patients who have problematic shin splints.<br /><h4><em>Taping</em></h4><br />Some patients derive benefit from taping their shins. This is done in an effort to dampen the muscle forces on the bone (decrease the whiplash effect).<br /><h4><em>Shock absorbing shoes and inserts</em></h4><br />The use of shoes and inserts with increased shock absorbing capacity may help to decrease the repetitive loads that the shins experience.<br /><h4><em>Medial arch supports</em></h4><br />Patients with <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/biomechanics-of-foot-and-ankle/foot-types/characteristics-of-flat-foot/">flat feet</a> and pain in the lower inner shin may benefit from an over-the-counter (pre-fabricated) medial arch support to help support their arch.<br /><h4><em>Graduated return to activity</em></h4><br />A gradual increase in activity back to pre-injury levels is essential in order to minimize the risk of recurrent symptoms.<br /><p>Edited December 21, 2016</p><br /><p></p>
Edited <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/kenneth-j-hunt-md-editor" target="_blank">Kenneth Hunt, MD</a></strong></em><em><strong> </strong></em><br /><h2>Summary</h2><br />Stress Fractures occur when excessive repetitive force is applied to a localized area of bone.  Activities such as walking, running, and repeated jumping can subject the bones of the foot to large forces, often leading to microscopic cracks in the bone, called “microfractures”.  Normally, the body is able to sufficiently heal these microfractures, leading to a stronger bone able to accommodate these higher forces in the future.  However, when the rate of loading on the foot is such that the body’s healing response can not keep up, a stress reaction can develop. Eventually, if the forces continue, the bone structure can fail and a stress fracture will occur. An individual’s lack of sufficient biology to heal microfractures (i.e., low calcium, vitamin D, or thyroid hormone) can also contribute or lead to stress fractures.<br /><h2>Indication</h2><br />Stress fractures occur in the same manner that you would break a paper clip – excessive wiggling back and force will lead to breakage. Stress fractures can occur in:<br /><ol><br /> 	<li><em>Normal bone that is subject to abnormally excessive repetitive loading.</em> An example of this would be a new army recruit going on a long march as part of basic training who, as a result of this dramatic increase in repetitive loading, develops a stress fracture (often called a <strong><em>“March” fracture</em></strong>).</li><br /> 	<li><em>Weakened bone that is subject to seemingly normal repetitive forces.</em> For example, a person with thin bone (ex. osteoporosis) who walks much more than they are used to.</li><br /></ol><br />Stress fractures do not occur in random locations. They occur in certain bones, and locations within those bones, that are absorbing excessive repetitive force. Each person’s foot absorbs force in a slightly different manner, which is dictated by that person’s  <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-types">foot shape</a></strong></em>, alignment, foot stiffness, and gait pattern. Common sites of stress fractures in the foot include:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em><strong>2nd or 3rd Metatarsal Neck Region</strong></em></li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/jones-fracture-5th-metatarsal-stress-fracture">Base of 5th Metatarsal (Jones Fracture)</a></strong></em></li><br /> 	<li><em><strong>Sesamoid of the Great Toe</strong></em></li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/navicular-stress-fracture">Navicular</a></strong></em></li><br /></ul><br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />Diagnosis of a stress fracture requires a high degree of suspicion as the fracture often does not show up on the initial x-ray.  Patients will usually report localized aching pain in the effected area.  They will give a history of some increase in their normal activity level (ex. went for a long hike this weekend).  They usually do not report a specific injury when the pain began. They may have a history of a condition that predisposes them to weaker bones such as:  Osteoporosis (weak thin bone); Amenorrhea (loss of normal menstrual cycle); or a history of smoking.<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />X-rays may initially be negative, as it often takes 10 days or more for a callus (new bone) to form and be visualized on x-rays.  Bone scans and MRIs are more likely to be positive in stress fractures.  It is possible, and in fact common, to see fluid or “edema” in bones on an MRI without having an obvious stress fracture.  This represents a “stress reaction”, and is equivalent to microscopic bone fracturing without a complete stress fracture. The fracture, if present, is usually visible on an MRI. If there is concern, a CT scan can usually confirm the diagnosis of stress fracture, as well as clearly define the location and size of the fracture.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br />Most stress fractures do not require surgery. Treatment generally involves:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li>Resting the effected area until the bone adequately heals, often 6-8 weeks or more. This can be accomplished with crutches and a CAM walker boot.</li><br /> 	<li>Avoiding any activities that caused the injury or exacerbate the symptoms.</li><br /> 	<li>Correcting any risk factor that may predispose to further stress fractures, including training issues, footwear, and nutritional or hormonal deficiencies.  Certain stress fractures may require surgery in order to aid in healing or prevent non-healing (i.e., non-union) or refracture. These “high risk” stress fractures include the <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/jones-fracture-5th-metatarsal-stress-fracture">Jones fracture</a></strong></em>, a displaced <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/navicular-stress-fracture">navicular stress fracture</a></strong></em>, and other stress fractures that may not heal adequately with non-surgical treatment. The decision for surgery should be made by an orthopaedic surgeon with experience treating these types of injuries.</li><br /></ul><br /><p align="right">Edited on November 2, 2016</p>
Edited by <strong><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/michael-castro-do-editor" target="_blank">Michael Castro MD</a></em></strong><br /><h2>Summary</h2><br />Subtalar arthritis is characterized by pain in the hindfoot that is aggravated by standing and walking, particularly on uneven ground. It is likely to be associated with stiffness when attempting to move the foot from side to side. The location of the pain is commonly just below the level of the inside and outside ankle bones (medial and lateral malleoli). The most common cause of subtalar arthritis is a previous injury - usually a <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/calcaneal-fracture">calcaneal fracture</a>, or abnormal alignment of the heal bone. Non-operative treatment involves: 1) limiting the movement and loading through the subtalar joint by wearing <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/comfort-shoes">comfort shoes</a>, <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-lacers">bracing the hindfoot</a> and weight control; 2) <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/activity-modification">activity modification </a>such as decreasing standing and walking, particularly on uneven terrain; and 3) masking the pain by taking NSAIDs, if tolerated, to improve pain control. Surgery is indicated for subtalar arthritis that has failed non-operative treatment. <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-fusion-arthrodesis">Fusion of the subtalar joint</a> is the most predictable surgical option, as it trades painful motion for relief of pain and improved function.<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />Patients with subtalar arthritis will complain of pain on one or both sides of the foot, just below the ankle bones (malleoli). This is commonly illustrated by the patient encircling the affected foot with their fingers, just below the level of the bony prominence on either side of the ankle (malleoli). The hollow just in front of the outside ankle bone (the sinus tarsi) is another common location of pain. The sinus tarsi is a space surrounded by the three contact areas between the talus and calcaneus, that comprise the subtalar joint. The subtalar joint is largely responsible for allowing the foot to accommodate uneven terrain by moving the hindfoot from side to side (inversion and eversion). Walking on uneven surfaces places a great deal of stress on the subtalar joint and may be difficult, if not impossible, to accomplish in patients with subtalar arthritis.Most subtalar arthritis is caused by a previous trauma, usually a <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/calcaneal-fracture">calcaneal fracture</a>, although certain fractures involving the talar body may also cause subtalar arthritis. Other causes include rheumatoid arthritis, or the abnormal loading of the subtalar joint associated with malalignment of the heel bone (calcaneus). The load applied to the subtalar joint can be unevenly distributed in cases where the heel bone turns in (varus alignment seen with a <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/characteristics-of-high-arched-foot-subtle-cavus">high arched foot</a>) or out (valgus alignment associated with a <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/characteristics-of-flat-foot">flat foot</a>).<br /><h2>Physical Examination</h2><br />On examination, patients with subtalar arthritis will usually have noticeable stiffness when testing side-to-side motion. Additionally, this motion may cause pain in the locations described above. There may also be swelling that may bulge above the shoe line.<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />X-rays will reveal a loss of the subtalar joint space that is best seen on a lateral view of the foot, taken with the patient bearing weight (Figure 1).<br /><h5>Figure 1- Subtalar Arthritis</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/subtalar-arthritis/figure-1-subtalar-arthritis/">^media_display_589c29b4de9125bcb7693139/position:center^</a>A CT scan or MRI is sometimes indicated to identify the extent of the subtalar arthritis and to determine if there is any other source of pain (ex. <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-arthritis">ankle arthritis</a>, <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/acquired-adult-flatfoot-deformity-posterior-tibial-tendon-dysfunction">posterior tibial tendonitis</a>, <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/peroneal-tendonitis">peroneal tendonitis</a>, etc.)Occasionally, a diagnostic injection of local anesthetic (ex. lidocaine) will be performed to get some sense of how much pain is originating from the subtalar joint. In some cases, the injection may be given with aid of ultrasound, fluoroscopy (mini x-ray), or CT scan, to ensure that the anesthetic agent is accurately placed. The lidocaine will only last a few hours and when it wears off the pain may actually be worse for a short while. However, if immediately after the injection the patient has a significant relief of pain for a few hours, this suggests that most of the symptoms are coming from the area that was injected - in this case the subtalar joint.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br /><h4>Non-Operative Treatment</h4><br />Non-operative treatment focuses on limiting the amount of loading and movement at the subtalar joint, and masking the pain. Non-operative treatment involves some trial and error on the part of the patient to see what strategies are most effective. Non-operative treatments include:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/activity-modification"><em>Activity Modification</em></a></strong>: Limiting standing and walking, particularly on uneven terrain, will help limit exacerbation of symptoms from subtalar arthritis. Use of an exercise bike or swimming as a form of aerobic exercise instead of walking or running, will likely be beneficial as it allows for a good workout with much less loading through the subtalar joint.</li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/weight-loss"><em>Weight-Loss</em></a></strong>:  The back part of the foot is subject to forces equivalent to 3-5x body weight during daily activities, so losing even a moderate amount of weight can substantially decrease the forces going through the arthritic joint.</li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/comfort-shoes"><em>Comfort Shoes</em></a>: </strong>Use of comfort shoes, including adding a shock absorber in the heal, can help decrease the repetitive loading through the subtalar joint.</li><br /> 	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-lacers"><em><strong>Ankle Bracing</strong></em></a>: Use of an ankle brace, such as an <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-lacers">ankle lacer</a></strong></em>, or even <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-taping">taping the ankle</a> </strong></em>and hindfoot can be helpful because it serves to limit motion through the arthritic subtalar joint.</li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/pain-control-post-surgery#ice"><em>Icing</em></a><em> and Elevation after Activity</em></strong>: Elevating the leg and placing a bag of ice around the ankle and hindfoot after activity can help to decrease pain and swelling. Ice should only be applied for 10-15 minutes at a time.</li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory-drugs-nsaids"><em>Anti-inflammatory medication (NSAIDs)</em></a></strong>: If there are no contra-indications, NSAIDs can help decrease a patient's arthritis symptoms</li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/non-operative-treatment/acetominophen/"><em>Tylenol</em></a></strong>: Plain Tylenol (acetaminophen) taken 2-3 times a day can help reduce the pain from subtalar arthritis. It may not be as effective as anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs), but it works via a different mechanism so it may have an additive effect. It should not be taken by anyone with liver problems</li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/glucosamine-sulfate"><em>Glucosamine Sulfate</em></a></strong>: Although it has not been shown to be beneficial in long-term studies, many people report improved symptom control when they take glucosamine sulfate. It needs to be taken daily for 6-8 week for any benefit to be seen.</li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/corticosteroid-injections"><em>Corticosteroid Injections</em></a></strong>:  Pain relief from corticosteroid injections will tend to be temporary.</li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/corticosteroid-injections"><em>Hylauronic Acid Injections</em></a></strong> (HA):  Injections of HA have shown some success in the knee joint, but the results in the subtalar joint has not been demonstrated.</li><br /> 	<li><strong><em>Self-Administered strengthening and stretching programs</em></strong>: Exercise to keep the muscles of the foot as strong as possible, and to keep the joint moving through a gentle range of motion, may be helpful.</li><br /></ul><br /><h4>Operative Treatment</h4><br />Operative treatment is usually reserved for extensive subtalar arthritis that has failed non-operative management. Occasionally patients will be noted to have an isolated area of damage to the subtalar joint, or will have a loose body which can addressed by cleaning out (debriding) the subtalar joint, either arthroscopically or more commonly by opening the joint. However in most instances, patients with subtalar arthritis have lost significant cartilage and need to have the <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/subtalar-fusion-arthrodesis">subtalar joint fused</a> (Figure 2).<br /><h5>Figure 2: Subtalar Fusion</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/subtalar-arthritis/figure-2-subtalar-fusion/">^media_display_589c29b6de9125bcb7693142/position:center^</a>A subtalar fusion is not to be confused with a subtalar arthroresis (placing a plug in the subtalar joint), which is not appropriate for treating subtalar arthritis.<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-fusion-arthrodesis"><em>Subtalar Fusion (Arthrodesis)</em></a></strong>: Fusing the subtalar joint is an effective treatment option for patients with significant subtalar arthritis that has failed non-operative management. When considering subtalar fusion, realize you are trading painful motion for pain relief. Even though the foot will lose side-to-side motion, often patients are able to be much more active because they have substantially less pain.</li><br /> 	<li>A <strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/subtalar-fusion">subtalar fusion</a></strong> is performed by cleaning out the remnants of cartilage from the joint, and putting screws and bone grafts across the joint. The goal is the union of the surfaces between the talus and the calcaneus (heel bone). This may require 6-10 weeks of activity restriction, and walking with crutches or using a knee scooter. Once healed, weight bearing is progressed until the patient is able to walk in regular shoes without the use of crutches. Physical therapy is important to improve ankle motion and balance. Patients can expect a significant improvement in their ability to walk by 3 to 4 months after surgery but, may not reach maximal improvement until 12-18 months after surgery.</li><br /></ul><br /> <br /><p align="right">Edited November 8, 2016</p>
Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/jean-brilhault-md-editor/">Jean Brilhault, MD, PhD</a></strong></em><br /><h2>Summary</h2><br />Talar neck fractures are very serious injuries.  They occur following a major force that drives the foot up against the ankle.  The ankle and foot will be swollen, painful, and possibly deformed.  The nature of the fracture will typically need to be investigated by performing x-rays and a CT scan.  Most talar neck fractures are displaced and will require surgery to reposition the bones back to their original position.  Recovery requires a prolonged period (6-12 weeks) of non-weight bearing.  Complications of the injury are unfortunately common and may include <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-arthritis">ankle arthritis</a></strong></em> due to loss of blood supply to the talus, <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/subtalar-arthritis">subtalar arthritis</a></strong></em>, and/or malalignment of the foot.<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />Talar neck fractures occur when there is a significant amount of force applied to the sole of the foot, forcing the foot to flex upwards (dorsiflex) and thereby driving the talar neck up against the front of the ankle joint. Talar neck fractures usually occur from high-energy injuries, such as a motor vehicle accident where the foot is driven into the floorboard, or by falling from a substantial height. As the foot is driven forward, the talar neck is forced onto the front of the ankle creating the fracture. Historically, this injury has been called &quot;aviator's astralgus&quot; (astralgus is a word meaning talus) because when pilots in World War I would crash their planes, their foot would often be driven up into the floorboards, leading to a talar neck fracture.In some instances, the force can be great enough to dislocate the talar body (the back part of the talus after the fracture) out of the ankle joint posterior (behind the ankle joint). It is also possible that the bone may actually break through the skin at the time of the injury, creating an open fracture. Symptoms of a talar neck fracture include marked pain, swelling, and the inability to bear any significant weight.<br /><h2>Physical Examination</h2><br />Patients will have swelling, localized discomfort around the ankle joint, and may or may not have a nerve injury. The foot may appear deformed in an angulated or twisted manner.<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />A talar neck fracture can be diagnosed via x-rays of the foot. The fracture will be identified extending through the talar neck region.  Occasionally, the fracture is undisplaced and can be difficult to read on plain x-rays. To more easily understand the fracture pattern, and particularly if surgery is a possibility, a CT scan will be ordered.<b><br /></b><br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br /><h3>Non-operative Treatment</h3><br />It is very rare for a talar neck fracture to be truly non-displaced.  However, if it is as demonstrated on the CT scan it may be treated non-surgically with non-weight-bearing and immobilization for 6-8 weeks until healing of the fracture has been documented.<br /><h3>Operative Treatment</h3><br />The treatment of a displaced talar neck fractures is operative (<em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/talar-neck-fracture-orif">talar neck ORIF</a></strong></em>) unless there is a contraindication to surgery. The goal of surgery is to return the talus to its original position prior to the fracture. Although this procedure may be challenging, it is very critical to get an anatomical reduction in order to avoid malalignment of the foot.  To optimize the chance of getting the fractured bones back exactly where they belong typically requires two incisions – one on the inside and one on the outside of the ankle.  The bones are then stabilized by screws and possibly a plate.<br /><h2>Potential Complications</h2><br /><h3>Specific Complications</h3><br />There are a variety of potential compilations that may occur following surgery to repair a talar neck fracture.  Most of these complications are related to the original injury itself, and not the actual surgery.  They include:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><i><strong>Avascular Necrosis</strong> (Osteonecrosis) of the talar body</i>. The nature of the injury often causes a loss of the blood supply to the back part of the talus – the part that forms the lower part of the ankle called the talar body.  This can cause this bone to collapse with resulting <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-arthritis">arthritis of the ankle joint</a></strong></em>.</li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/subtalar-arthritis" target="_blank"><i>Subtalar Arthritis</i></a></strong>. The injury can also lead to arthritis in the joint below the talar body (the subtalar joint).</li><br /> 	<li><i><strong>Malalignment of the foot</strong></i>. The position of the talar neck dictates how the rest of the foot is aligned.  If the bone cannot be restored to its original position due to bone loss or technical challenges, then the foot may be malpositioned (ex. curved inwards).</li><br /></ul><br /><h3>General Complications</h3><br />There are the usual variety of potential complications which may occur following surgery to fix a talar neck fracture.  These include:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#infection"><i>Infection</i></a></strong></li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems"><i>Wound healing problems</i></a></strong></li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#dvt"><i>Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)</i></a></strong></li><br /> 	<li><strong><i><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#pe">Pulmonary Embolism (PE</a><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#dvt" target="_blank"><i>)</i></a></strong></i></strong></li><br /></ul><br /><i> </i><br /><p align="right">Edited on November 30, 2016</p><br /> 
Edited by <strong><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/anthony-van-bergeyk-md-editor">Anthony Van Bergeyk MD</a></em></strong><br /><h2>Summary</h2><br />A tarsal coalition is a condition where one or more of the bones of the hindfoot (talus, calcaneus, and navicular) do not fully separate during development. These bones normally split apart (forming a joint) in the early part of pregnancy when the embryo is developing.  The coalition holding the bones together can range from flexible fibrous tissue, cartilage, or a rigid bridge of solid bone. The effect of a tarsal coalition is that the position of the hindfoot tends to be fixed in patients with a tarsal coalition. Sometimes the foot is fixed in a neutral position but sometimes it is fixed in a fairly flatfooted position. In either case, the hindfoot does not move normally.<br />The most common tarsal coalitions are:<br /><ol><br /> 	<li><em>Talo-calcaneal coalition</em>: In this case the talus (lower bone of the ankle) and the calcaneus (heel bone) have not fully separated.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Calcaneo-navicular coalition</em>: In this case the front part (beak) of the calcaneus is attached to the outside and lower (lateral) part of the navicular.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Talo-navicular coalition</em>: This coalition is less common and results when the talar head and the navicular do not fully separate.</li><br /></ol><br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />Many tarsal coalitions are asymptomatic and people may live their whole life without realizing that they have a tarsal coalition. However, certain tarsal coalitions can create symptoms which in some individuals can be quite significant. The main symptoms are:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em>Pain</em> (which can occur in various areas of the foot) and;</li><br /> 	<li><em>A fixed foot deformity (usually a flatfoot </em>–Figure 1): The most common time that symptoms will occur is during adolescence (ages 12-16). During this time period, children are often growing and gaining weight and therefore more force is going through the foot. At some point the limitations created by the tarsal coalition may lead to symptoms. For example, a fibrous coalition can become irritated creating pain, or a fixed foot position (ex. flatfoot) can lead to an overload of certain tendons (ex. Posterior tibial tendon in the case of a flatfoot) producing tendonitis like symptoms. As patients get older they may develop painful arthritis in one or more of their hindfoot joints (ex. Subtalar arthritis or talonavicular arthritis). This occurs because the joints surrounding the joint affected by the tarsal coalition have limited motion and are subject to increased stress that can cause the joint to lose cartilage (arthritis) over time.</li><br /></ul><br /><h5>Figure 1: Flatfoot in a Child due to a Tarsal Coalition</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Figure-1-Flatfoot-in-a-Child-due-to-a-Tarsal-Coalition.png">^media_display_589c29b8de9125bcb7693147/position:center^</a><br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />Often a tarsal coalition can be diagnosed on a plain x-ray of the ankle or the foot. There are certain plain x-ray signs that are classic for certain tarsal coalition including:<br /><ol><br /> 	<li>&quot;<em>C-Sign&quot; </em>(Figure 2): seen in talo-calcaneal coalition - in which the bony contour of the coalition between the talus and the calcaneus form a smooth C-shaped line</li><br /> 	<li>&quot;<em>Ant eater sign&quot;</em> seen in a calcaneo-navicular coalition</li><br /></ol><br /><h5>Figure 2: C-Sign Demonstrating Talo-Calcaneal Tarsal Coalition on X-Ray</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Figure-2-C-Sign-Talo-Calcaneal-Coalition.png">^media_display_589c29bade9125bcb769314a/position:center^</a>However, in many instances a tarsal coalition will not be seen on a regular x-ray and a CT scan or MRI will be needed to establish the diagnosis. CT scan can best determine the extent of bone bridging in larger coalitions, but MRI is best for smaller, non-bony coalition lesions<br /><h2>Non-Operative Treatment</h2><br />A variety of non-operative treatments may be helpful in managing the symptoms of a patient with a symptomatic tarsal coalition. These include:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/activity-modification"><em>Activity Modification</em></a>: Eliminating precipitating activities (ex. Walking on uneven terrain) or limiting activities in the short-term can be helpful in decreasing symptoms. By decreasing the repetitive load through the painful area symptoms will often settle.</li><br /> 	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/comfort-shoes"><em>Comfortable well-fitted shoes</em></a>: Shoes that help disperse the force evenly up the leg and or limit motion of the hindfoot can help decrease the localized forces going through the hindfoot joint that has the coalition (and the adjacent joints) and thereby decrease symptoms. Typically a shoe with a stiff sole and a slight curve to the sole (rocker-bottom contour) will be more comfortable.</li><br /> 	<li><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/pre-fabricated-over-the-counter-orthotics-insert">Orthotics</a></em>: Inexpensive supportive over-the-counter (OTC) orthotics can help symptoms as well in some cases.</li><br /> 	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-lacers"><em>Ankle Bracing</em></a>: Ankle bracing such as an <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-lacers">ankle lacer</a> or in some cases an Arizona ankle lacer can help limit the motion through the painful areas and can thereby significantly improve symptoms.</li><br /> 	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory-drugs-nsaids"><em>Anti-inflammatory medication</em></a>: The short-term or regular use of anti-inflammatory medication (provided there are no contra-indications) may be helpful in controlling the symptoms associated with a tarsal coalition.</li><br /> 	<li><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/non-operative-treatment/corticosteroid-injections/">Injection</a>:</em> Occasionally a lidocaine (local freezing will be used to help diagnose the source of pain and a corticosteroid injection may be used to provide some temporary relief of symptoms.</li><br /></ul><br /><h2>Operative Treatment</h2><br />In some instances surgical intervention is warranted.

Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/vinod-k-panchbhavi-md-editor" target="_blank">Vinod Panchbhavi MD</a></strong></em><br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />Patients with tarsal tunnel syndrome present with pain in the inside of the ankle or heel region that radiates into the sole of their foot (Figure 1). This pain can have a sharp, shooting, dull, or burning feeling and may be associated with numbness. The pain is often worse with activity and towards the evening.    The pain occurs because tarsal tunnel syndrome affects the tibial nerve or its branches as they course under tight structures with limited space along the inner aspect of the ankle and down along the inner aspect of the heel and turning into the sole.There is some question as to whether this condition exists as an isolated entity as it is commonly seen in conjunction with other conditions such as <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/plantar-fasciitis">plantar fasciitis</a> and <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/acquired-adult-flatfoot-deformity-posterior-tibial-tendon-dysfunction">acquired adult flatfoot deformity</a>. In all of these conditions, the structures on the inside of the ankle (posterior medial structures including the branches of the tibial nerve) are placed under repetitive stress (Figure 2). Patients with irritation to the tibial nerve can be quite uncomfortable. Excessive walking and increased body weight can exacerbate the patient's symptoms.<br /><h5>Figure 1: Typical pain location</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/tarsal-tunnel-syndrome-Figure-1.png">^media_display_589c29bcde9125bcb769314e/position:center^</a><br /><h5>Figure 2: Repetitive Stretching of inner ankle region leading to tibial nerve irritation</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/tarsal-tunnel-syndrome-Figure-2.jpg">^media_display_589c29bdde9125bcb7693151/position:center^</a>Repetitive injury to the tibial nerve can be due to a repetitive traction on the nerve, which creates some recurrent injury to the nerve and nerve sheath. This can lead to scarring of the nerve with resulting painful symptoms. Tarsal tunnel is quite different than carpal tunnel syndrome! Carpal tunnel syndrome is seen in the wrist, where direct compression of the nerve produces the chronic injury and subsequent symptoms. The majority of diagnoses of tarsal tunnel syndrome are related to traction on the nerve. However, in small number of cases, there will be a physical mass, such as a bone spur or a <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ganglion-cysts">ganglion</a> that can press and injure the tibial nerve or its branches (Figure 3). Also, rarely the structures around the nerve are swollen or diseased such as inflamed tendons coursing along the tibial nerve and can affect the nerves similarly.<br /><h2>Physical Examination</h2><br />On physical examination, patients will often have a flatfoot type. Direct palpation over the inside of the ankle (posteromedial) will often reveal a localized area of pain with symptoms radiating into the sole of the foot. If direct pressure or tapping on the nerve reproduces patients symptoms, it is called a &quot;Tinel's sign&quot;. Sensory examination of the foot may reveal some decreased sensation on the sole of the foot, although in most patients this is not the case.Nerve conduction studies will often show a decrease in conduction of electrical pulses over the course of the tibial nerve.It is also important to rule out nerve compression in the low back area. There is a fairly high correlation between nerve compression in the spine region (ex from a disk or spinal stenosis) and tarsal tunnel-type symptoms. This is important because local treatments may not be effective if the real problem is at the level of the low back.<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />Weightbearing x-rays of the foot should be assessed to review for any obvious pathology in the hindfoot. A CT scan or MRI is sometimes indicated to rule out a mass, which may be irritating the nerve (Figure 3).<br /><h5>Figure 3: MRI showing a fluid-filled ganglion that is compressing the tibial nerve.</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Figure-3-Tarsal-Tunnel-Syndrome-Ganglion-Panchbhavi-04-19-2014.png">^media_display_589c29bede9125bcb7693154/position:center^</a><br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br />The vast majority of patients with tarsal tunnel syndrome can (and should) be treated nonoperatively. The primary approach to treating this condition is to attempt to decrease the repetitive traction injury across the nerve and the other structures in this area of the foot. In this regard, treatment is quite similar to that for <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/acquired-adult-flatfoot-deformity-posterior-tibial-tendon-dysfunction">acquired adult flatfoot deformity</a> and <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/plantar-fasciitis">plantar fasciitis</a>. In fact, these three conditions together have been labeled as the terrible triad and it is not uncommon to see them all together in one patient. This patient is typically someone with a flattened arch of the foot who is overweight.<br /><h4>Non-Operative treatment</h4><br /><ul><br /> 	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/comfort-shoes"><em>Comfort shoes </em></a>designed to disperse the force more evenly across the foot can be very helpful.</li><br /> 	<li><em>A prefabricated orthotic</em> with a supportive arch will help to disperse the force more evenly across the foot may also be helpful.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Stretching exercises</em> designed to <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/calf-stretch">stretch the calf muscle </a>and thereby indirectly decrease the load through this area of the foot may also be helpful.</li><br /> 	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/weight-loss"><em>Weight loss</em></a> will often end up being a critically important component of non-operative treatment, as this will serve to decrease the repetitive forces through this area of the foot.</li><br /> 	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/non-operative-treatment/activity-modification/"><em>Activity modification</em></a> to limit the amount of standing and walking and thereby the amount of repetitive injury to this area is also an important component of nonoperative management.

However, it is unclear what effect they have in the long term. In addition it is possible to injure the nerve during the injection process.</li><br /></ul><br /><h4>Operative Treatment</h4><br />Tarsal tunnel release has been proposed as a treatment for tarsal tunnel syndrome. Operative treatment should be undertaken with great caution! Patients who undergo operative treatment can be left worse than they were prior to the surgery. This is because operative intervention involves surgery around the tibial nerve. This invariably leaves some surgical scarring around the nerve, hopefully (but not necessarily) with less compression on the nerve than what was there prior to surgery! In addition, operative treatment that only addresses the nerve will usually not address the underlying reason why the patient was having a repetitive or compression injury to the nerve in the first place.Operative treatment typically involves a neurolysis of the tibial nerve. This means identifying and freeing up the tibial nerve as it passes the inside of the ankle and hindfoot. This is done by releasing any tight structures and removing any obvious scar on the outer aspect of the nerve. This surgery will have a tendency to leave some scar by the nature of the operative insult. The hope is that more compressing tissue is removed than does recur.It has been suggested that tarsal tunnel syndrome in conjunction with a mass effect, such as a bone spur or ganglion cyst, may do better. In theory, removing the mass should help the patient's symptoms. In practice, this is not always proven to be the case.<br /><h2>Potential Surgical Complications</h2><br />The main potential surgical complication that is specific to tarsal tunnel release is failure to eradicate the symptoms and in some cases, making the symptoms worse. Essentially, the nerve is often under traction and a strict freeing up of the nerve (neurolysis) will not do anything to address this. Furthermore, by operating around the nerve, any postoperative bleeding will have a tendency to scar the nerve further. The operation may leave the patient very hypersensitive in the area of surgery.Other potential complications that are not specific to tarsal tunnel surgery include:<a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems">Wound healing problems</a><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#infection">Infection</a><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#dvt">Deep Venous Thromobis (DVT)</a><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#pe">Pulmonary embolism</a><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications/#crps">Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS)</a> <br /><p>Edited November 2, 2016</p>
<h4>Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/kenneth-j-hunt-md-editor" target="_blank">Ken Hunt, MD</a></strong></em></h4><br /><h2>Summary</h2><br />Acute toe injuries including fractures are common. These injuries typically occur when a heavy object (i.e., weight) is dropped on the foot or the toes are kicked against a solid object such as a bed frame.  Toe fractures can produce significant pain and swelling. Patients will often walk with a pronounced limp or they may not want to bear any weight on the foot. In addition to fractures, patients may also have symptoms from soft tissue injuries such as injuries to the ligaments and tendons surrounding the small joints of the toes. In each of these instances, as with the fracture, there would be a significant increase in blood flow to the relatively confined space of the toes. This leads to swelling and pain and can make walking and wearing shoes very difficult.<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />Usually, patients with toe injuries will have an area of localized tenderness at the site of the injury. This is often associated with bruising, swelling, and sometimes burning pains. These symptoms will help make the diagnosis. In addition, the physician will assess the vascularity and sensation associated with the toes, as these can be compromised in a significant acute injury. It is important to determine if there are injuries (and symptoms) in other parts of the foot as well. An isolated toe injury typically does not affect the stability of the foot. However, fractures or injuries further up the foot can prevent the patient from weight-bearing, or potentially create further damage with weight bearing. Finally, it is important to assess the position and alignment of the toes. The toes should have normal length compared to the other foot and neighboring toes. Also, there should not be abnormal rotation or angular (i.e., crooked) deformities of the toes. Any obvious deformity suggests that a fracture or dislocation of one of the joints may be present. If there is a significant deformity these injuries often need to be realigned to ensure appropriate healing.<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />X-rays are taken to assess the bones for fractures as well as review the alignment of the toes and assess for injuries to the small joints of the toes. However, the clinical examination is perhaps more important than the x-rays in terms of choosing the correct treatment.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br />The vast majority of toe injuries including fractures can be treated without surgery. If the toe is in acceptable position, the initial treatment consists of:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/pain-control-post-surgery"><em>Rest</em></a></strong></li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/pain-control-post-surgery"><em>Elevation</em> (to decrease swelling)</a></strong></li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/pain-control-post-surgery"><em>Pain medication</em> (as required)</a></strong></li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/pain-control-post-surgery"><em>Ice</em> (to decrease blood flow to the area)</a></strong></li><br /></ul><br />As the patient feels more comfortable, they can begin mobilizing in a stiff-soled shoe. A very stiff shoe minimizes or eliminates motion through the toes, therefore, decreasing the symptoms as the patient starts to walk again. During the recovery period, it would be helpful for the patient to keep the foot elevated as much as possible. Having the foot down in a dependent position will tend to cause significant swelling due to the increased blood flow to the toe area. This can produce more pain and potential skin problems.A common way of treating an isolated toe fracture is with buddy taping. The toe is aligned with the adjacent toe. Soft spacers placed between the injured toe and the adjacent toe are then gently wrapped together. The uninjured toe serves as a splint for the injured toe.A typical toe fracture will take about 6 weeks to heal. However, residual swelling and dysfunction can persist for even longer. It is not uncommon to still have residual symptoms following a significant toe injury even 3-4 months after the injury.<br /><h2>Surgical Treatment</h2><br />Surgery and/or manipulation of the toe under anesthesia to correct alignment is reserved for patients who have a significant deformity. If a pronounced deformity is present, this will not correct on its own.  In fact, if the alignment is not corrected, the toe may become very stiff in the abnormally aligned position, producing worsening symptoms, arthritis, and even impacting the neighboring toes. In these instances, patients may benefit from manipulation and even fixation of the fracture. Fracture fixation often includes a long wire called a K-wire. The patients are given a local or general anesthetic, the toe is manipulated into an improved position reducing the fracture deformity. The fracture is then stabilized with either a K-wire or sometimes merely with buddy taping. In some cases, very small plates can be applied to the bones to hold the alignment as the fracture heals.<br /><p>updated October 28, 2016</p>

Edited by <strong><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/sam-dellenbaugh/" target="_blank">Sam Dellenbaugh, MD</a></em></strong><br /><h2>Procedure</h2><br />End (late)-stage <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/hallux-rigidus-hallux-limitus">hallux rigidus</a></strong></em> can also be managed with a great toe joint replacement (1st MTP joint replacement).  The goal of this surgery is relieving the patient's pain while, at the same time, retaining any remaining motion present at this joint. When successful, this procedure arguably represents an advantage over the fusion surgery alternative, although one must consider the fact that joint replacement surgery in this area remains an inherently more unpredictable intervention, in terms of implant longevity and success.Many different implants are available for this procedure, and have been designed to specifically resurface the 1st MTP joint on its near side, far side, and/or both sides, depending on surgeon preference and primary disease location in the patient. Regardless of implant choice, it is imperative that the patient discuss with the doctor beforehand all the pros, cons, risks, and benefits of these various surgical options.Since the arthritic great toe joint (<em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/hallux-rigidus-hallux-limitus">hallux rigidus</a></strong></em>) is already stiff to begin with, and only limited improvement of motion can be expected with implantation of any type of 1st MTP joint replacement, this procedure should be undertaken with caution and only after complete understanding of the risks and benefits of such intervention.<br /><h2>Recovery</h2><br />Different implants may require different postoperative protocols, which should be discussed. In general, a 6-week period of relative inactivity should be expected, followed by a progressive physical therapy program, weight bearing, and transition to regular shoe wear over the ensuing 1-2 months. Like many foot surgeries, maximum improvement can take upwards of one year post-operatively.<br /><h2>Potential General Complications</h2><br /><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems">Wound healing problems<br /></a></strong></em><em><strong>Wound infection<br /></strong></em><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#nerve-injury">Local Nerve Injury</a></strong></em><br /><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#dvt">Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)</a></strong></em><br /><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#pe">Pulmonary Embolism (PE)</a></strong></em><br /><h2>Potential Specific Complications</h2><br /><h3>Failure of the joint replacement over time</h3><br />This can be a very difficult situation if it occurs. All joint replacements have a tendency to wear and eventually fail over time, since they are not made of living material. The great toe joint replacement (1st MTP replacement) is no exception. In fact, replacements involving the great toe joint (first MTP joint) can be particularly problematic, as this joint is subject to a significant amount of force with each step. Unfortunately, failure of this joint replacement can be catastrophic because it is often associated with a significant loss of bone stock, which leaves a large void or &quot;hole&quot; behind once the implant is removed. This can make salvage options limited and somewhat challenging.<br /><h3>Deep infection of the implant</h3><br />Although unusual, infection can develop with these implants, either early on or sometimes years after implantation. Either situation is very problematic for both doctor and patient, since deep infection more often than not necessitates complete removal of the implant for successful treatment. This too leaves a large void behind, and salvage options are also limited.<br /><p>Edited January 24, 2017</p><br /><p></p>
Edited by <strong><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/gwyneth-devries-md-frcsc-editor/">Gwyneth deVries, MD FRCSC</a></em></strong><br /><h2>Indications</h2><br />A cheilectomy involves removal of bone spurs that involve the top part of the big toe joint (1st MTP joint).  These bone spurs occur as a result of early arthritis of the joint and can cause pain and limited motion of the big toe.  The word “cheilectomy” means “the cutting away of a lip of bone”.This procedure is indicated in those with painful, limited motion of the big toe that does not respond to nonsurgical treatment. This is done to allow increased motion through the big toe MTP joint, to decrease shoe wear irritation from the prominence (bump), and to eliminate some early arthritis on the upper surface of the joint. This procedure is effective only for patients who have arthritis involving the top part (dorsal aspect) of the great toe joint (first MTP joint). While older patients more commonly have arthritis of the big toe, it can be seen in younger adults due to sports trauma or other conditions. In all age groups, the bone spur removal is designed to improve mobility of the joint. Some occupations and recreational activities may require this joint mobility, so it is important to advise your surgeon of all activities to discuss realistic expectations of this procedure.The cheilectomy procedure is not indicated in patients with extensive arthritis involving the entire joint (i.e. more severe or end/late-stage <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/hallux-rigidus-hallux-limitus/">hallux </a>rigidus).<br /><h2>Procedure</h2><br />A cheilectomy does not involve and metal or other implants, it is a trimming of bone from the area of the bump or spur (Figure 1). The procedure is performed by making an incision centered over the top of the 1st MTP joint.  The tendon that extends the big toe is protected.  The cartilage of the joint is inspected.  Typically, the top third of the first MTP joint has arthritic changes. This bone spur and arthritic area is removed in order to allow increased motion and improvement in symptoms. The incision is typically about 5-7 cm long, and sutures or surgical clips are used to close the incision. A sterile bandage or wrap is used to protect the area after surgery. The procedure is performed as day surgery in almost all cases. Many surgeons will offer an option of local anesthesia for the procedure. The most common reasons for overnight hospital stays are related to management of other medical conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure or asthma. In some patients, pain control can be an issue that is best handled prior to going home.<br /><h5>Figure 1:  Great Toe Cheilectomy (bone spur removal) for treatment of mild Hallux Rigidus (arthritis of great toe)</h5><br />^media_display_589c29c0de9125bcb769315c/position:center^<br /><h2>Recovery</h2><br />Patients are typically able to rapidly remobilize with weight bearing as tolerated in a stiff-soled shoe almost immediately after surgery. Instructions for bandage and wound care are given. Some patients prefer to use crutches or a cane for a few days after surgery for comfort. Most patients will take a few days off from work or school in order to have the freedom to elevate the foot frequently to control swelling. Sutures are removed as soon as the incision heals, usually about 2 weeks after surgery. Range of motion exercises and occasionally physical therapy are started once the wound has healed. A simple exercise of gently moving the great toe up and down is important to prevent stiffness. Normal walking helps to promote the upward motion, although some patients subconsciously walk temporarily on “the outside border” of the foot to decrease pressure on the big toe. Using a mirror to walk ‘Heel-to-toe’ can help to improve confidence to put normal pressure on the big toe.Most patients are able to resume their usual lifestyle within a few weeks, although certain high-intensity activities will not be possible right away. Residual pain and swelling can be expected to limit some activities or even work for about three months post-operatively. Return to intensive sport or demanding physical situations is usually possible by six months. Each person’s recovery will depend on a number of factors so these timelines are estimates only.Driving must not be attempted while “impaired” so pain and stiffness should be resolved before returning to safe operation of a motor vehicle. This is usually 2-4 weeks after surgery, possibly longer in some individuals.Footwear may be an issue in the recovery period due to swelling of the toe and possibly the surrounding area. Most patients report relief in their old footwear given that the uncomfortable bump has been removed.Arthritis symptoms usually resolve about one month after surgery. Patients can experience relief for up to 10 years following the surgery. Actual mobility of the joint varies from patient to patient, but most report a satisfactory improvement, with gains in mobility continuing up to a year after surgery.<br /><h2>Potential Complications</h2><br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em>Progression of arthritis: </em>There is the very real potential for a recurrence or persistence of symptoms after a great toe cheilectomy. This can occur relatively quickly if there was more wear and tear arthritis in the great toe joint than expected. In addition, this surgery does not fully correct the underlying biomechanical forces that caused the arthritic changes in the first place. Therefore, over time the great toe symptoms may have a tendency to recur. If the symptoms recur, it may be necessary to perform a more definitive procedure, such as a<em> </em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/great-toe-fusion-1st-mtp-joint-fusion"><strong><em>great toe fusion</em></strong></a> or a <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/1st-metatarsal-phalangeal-mtp-joint-replacement-arthroplasty"><strong><em>1st MTP joint replacement</em></strong></a>.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Local nerve irritation:<em> </em></em>Irritation to the nerves supplying the big toe can occur as a result of this procedure. In some patients, a partially “numb” area of the big toe results from the surgery. Most nerve problems resolve in about six weeks.</li><br /> 	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems"><strong><em>Wound healing problems</em></strong></a>: In most patients, the wound heals with no problems. In patients with medical conditions such as diabetes or inflammatory arthritis, the surgeon may give special postoperative instructions. Smoking may interfere with wound healing, and all advice regarding management of smoking should be carefully followed. In physically active patients, returning “too soon” to regular footwear, or high-intensity activity, can result in unwanted irritation of the wound, even after the wound has healed and the sutures have been removed.</li><br /> 	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#infection"><strong><em>Infection</em></strong></a>: A sharp increase in pain, accompanied by redness and tenderness of the skin may indicate infection. If infection occurs it is usually related to the surface of the wound and is easily recognized and treated, usually with oral antibiotics. If a deeper infection is suspected, intravenous antibiotics may be necessary. Seek a medical opinion if there is a concern about infection (painful redness of the wound, possibly associated with fluid leaking from the wound). Be sure advise of any unusual exposures to soils, fungus, pets or travel if infection is suspected or diagnosed.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Blood Clots or Deep Vein Thrombosis</em>: In any foot surgery, there is a small risk of developing a blood clot. Since a cheilectomy procedure allows for early mobility, the risk of blood clot is very low. If the lower leg becomes swollen and sore, this should be investigated.   If you have had a blood clot in the past, or have risk factors for blood clots, advise your surgeon. Medication to thin the blood may be prescribed around the time of surgery and may need to be taken for a number of weeks after surgery.</li><br /></ul><br /> <br /><p>Edited on January 24, 2017 (Originally edited by  <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/daniel-cuttica-do-editor/"><strong><em>Daniel Cuttica, DO</em></strong></a>)<span style="font-size: 10px;"> </span></p>
<h2>Indication</h2><br />A rotational 5th metatarsal osteotomy (cutting and rotating the bone) is indicated for patients with a large, painful <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/bunionette">bunionette</a> deformity that has failed non-operative management. The deformity is associated with an enlarged angle between the 4th and 5th metatarsal bones.<br /><h2>Procedure</h2><br />A 5th metatarsal osteotomy (bone cut) is performed through an incision on the outside of the foot.  The dissection is carried down to the bone.  The outside of the bone is identified and an incomplete oblique cut is made ¾ of the way through the bone.  A drill is then placed from top to bottom through the bone and a screw is positioned, but not tightened, in this hole.  The remainder of the bone cut is then made.  After the cut has been made, the far end (distal part) of the 5th metatarsal is rotated inwards towards the 4th metatarsal, reducing the deformity and allowing for the bunionette correction.  The screw is then tightened to stabilize this position, which is reviewed under x-ray.  With the bone rotated, there is now a prominent area of bone on the outside (laterally).  This is cut off and smoothed.  The 5th toe is then straightened up through the capsule on the outside of the base of the 5th toe, allowing for improved positioning of this toe.<br /><h2>Recovery</h2><br />Recovery requires that the cut bone heal.

Edited by <em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/vinod-k-panchbhavi-md-editor/">Vinod K. Panchbhavi, MD</a></em><br /><h2>Indication</h2><br />An Achilles tendon repair is often performed as treatment for a <em><strong><a href="/achilles-tendon-rupture">ruptured Achilles tendon</a>.</strong></em><br /><h2>Procedure</h2><br /><h3>Open Achilles Tendon repair</h3><br />An Achilles tendon repair is most commonly performed through an open incision, located over the site of tendon rupture at the back of the leg. The incision is dissected down to the ruptured Achilles tendon. Once the ruptured Achilles is reached, the torn ends are trimmed and cleaned up to suture them for reattachment. The ankle is positioned with toes pointing down so that the repair can be performed and the area of the repair is not under tension.  Once tendon ends have been secured the wound is carefully closed. (see Figure 1)<br /><h3>Mini-Open Incision</h3><br />Another technique that is sometimes used to repair a ruptured Achilles is performed through a &quot;mini-open&quot; incision. In this procedure, a small horizontal incision or sometimes a vertical incision is made over the Achilles. A commercially available device is then used to facilitate the reconnection of the ruptured tendon with sutures in a blinded manner. The advantages of the mini-open technique include less soft tissue damage and less scaring and better cosmesis. However, the disadvantages include a higher rate of local nerve injuries as unlike in the open procedure the sutures are introduced without exposing the full length of the tendon which can make it difficult to ensure that the nerve is out of the way of the repair. The nerve that can potentially be injured may cause numbness over the side of the foot near the little toe. It is possible that the repair itself may not be as strong as the more common technique potentially leading to a higher re-rupture rate. (see Figure 2)<br /><h5>Figure 1: Open repair of Achilles tendon rupture</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Figure-11.jpg">^media_display_589c29c2de9125bcb7693161/position:center^</a>       <br /><h4></h4><br /><h5>Figure 2: Mini-Open Incision Repair</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Figure-21.jpg">^media_display_589c29c3de9125bcb7693164/position:center^</a><br /><h2>Recovery</h2><br /><h3>Typical Standard Recovery</h3><br />During the first 6-8 weeks, the foot is immobilized in a cast to allow the tendon and the surrounding tissues to heal properly. In addition, the tendon needs to be protected because the healing Achilles tendon may still be too weak to withstand the force of normal walking. After the 6-8 weeks, patients are placed in a removable boot, often with a small heel lift to take some of the load off of the Achilles. At this point, patients can begin walking, but at a slow pace initially. Physical therapy working on range of motion and low resistance strengthening is usually started at 6-8 weeks post surgery. Gradually over a series of weeks, the heel lift is removed, bringing the ankle back into its neutral position. In a traditional recovery, the patient can transition into a regular shoe around 9-14 weeks post-surgery.<br /><h3>More Aggressive Achilles Rehabilitation</h3><br />Younger, more athletic patients who are very disciplined might benefit from a more <em><strong><a href="/aggressive-athletic-rehab-for-achilles-tendon">Aggressive Athletic Rehabilitation</a></strong></em>.<br /><h2>Potential General Complications</h2><br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#asymmetric-gait">Asymmetric Gait (leading to pain elsewhere)</a></strong></em></li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#dvt">Deep Vein Thrombosis</a><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#dvt"> (</a><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#dvt">Blood Clot)</a></strong></em></li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#pe">Pulmonary Embolism (PE)</a></strong></em></li><br /> 	<li>Scar Irritation</li><br /></ul><br />The incision can be made in two different locations: on the back or on the side of the Achilles. Although the incision can be made on the back of the Achilles, an incision on the side will tend to avoid irritation from the scar when rubbed against the shoe during normal walking.<br /><h2>Potential Specific Complications</h2><br /><ul><br /> 	<li><strong><em><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems">Wound healing<br /></a></em></strong>Although this is usually a general complication for most procedures, the wound healing complication is particularly concerning for an Achilles tendon repair. This is because the tendon itself has relatively little soft-tissue coverage and this area of skin has a notoriously poor blood supply. Therefore, any type of wound healing problem can easily end up involving the tendon itself. For most patients, there is approximately a 2-5% chance of a significant wound healing problem. However, the risk of a wound healing problem increases significantly in smokers and diabetics.</li><br /> 	<li><strong><em><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#infection">Infection</a></em></strong><br />A deep infection following an Achilles tendon repair can be a devastating problem. Often, an infection will occur if there is an associated wound healing problem that allows bacteria from the outside world to contaminate the Achilles repair. Treatment may require not only antibiotics, but potentially the removal of all suture materials and, in some instances, removal of the tendon itself. Smokers and Diabetics are at an increased risk of a serious wound infection following Achilles Tendon repair surgery.</li><br /> 	<li><strong><em>Re-rupture of the Achilles Tendon</em></strong>:<br />The re-rupture rate is significantly lower in operatively (Achilles Tendon Repair) treated patients (2-5%) compared to patients treated non-operatively (8-15%). However, re-rupture is still a known complication.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>Edited February 1, 2017</p><br /><p></p>

These include:<br /><ul><br />	<li><em>Synovitis. S</em>ynovitis is inflammation of the lining of the ankle joint (synovium). This can cause pain, swelling, and limit movement of the ankle.  Synovitis may occur from an injury, arthritis or overuse.  Arthroscopy can be used to remove the inflamed synovium.</li><br />	<li><em>Impingement.</em> Impingement of the ankle can occur in the front (<a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/anterolateral-ankle-impingement-dukes-lesion/"><em><strong>anterolateral</strong></em></a> or <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/anterior-ankle-impingement/"><em><strong>anterior impingement</strong></em></a>) or back of the ankle (<a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/posterior-ankle-impingement-os-trigonum-syndrome/"><em><strong>posterior ankle impingement</strong></em></a>). It can cause pain and limit movement of the ankle.  Arthroscopy can be used to remove the source of the pain.</li><br />	<li><strong><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/osteochondral-lesions-of-talus-olt-talar-ocds-talar-ocls/">Osteochondritis dessicans</a></em></strong></li><br />	<li><em>Loose bodies.</em> Sometimes a loose piece of bone or cartilage can dislodge from within the ankle joint.  This piece can be removed with arthroscopy</li><br />	<li> <em>Infection.</em> Infections can sometimes occur in the ankle joint either from a previous surgery or from spreading from another place in the body.  Arthroscopy may be used to remove infectious tissue and to clean the joint with water to aid in removing the infection.</li><br />	<li><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/ankle-arthritis/"><strong>Ankle arthritis</strong></a>. </em>Arthroscopy may be used clean bone spurs, and inflamed tissue or loose cartilage associated with ankle arthritis. This does not fix the arthritis but may potentially help in temporarily improving pain.  In very specific situations, arthroscopy may be used to perform an <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/surgical-procedures/ankle-fusion-arthrodesis/"><em><strong>ankle fusion</strong> </em></a>which is one type of surgical treatment for ankle arthritis.</li><br />	<li><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/ankle-instability/"><strong>Ankle instability</strong></a>.</em> Arthroscopy may be used to repair ankle instability. This often requires tightening of the ligaments of the outside of the ankle (<a href="http://www.footeducation.com/surgical-procedures/lateral-ankle-ligament-repair-reconstruction-brostrom-procedure/"><em><strong>lateral ligament reconstruction</strong></em></a>).</li><br />	<li><strong><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/ankle-fracture/">Ankle fractures</a></em></strong>. Some ankle fractures extend into the ankle joint itself.  Ankle arthroscopy can help ensure the break is aligned correctly.</li><br /></ul><br /><h2>Procedure</h2><br />Ankle arthroscopy typically involves two 3mm incisions in the front of the ankle. Through one of the incisions a pencil sized camera is placed in the ankle.  The camera is able to project the live images from the ankle onto a television type monitor.  The surgeon is able to then see inside the ankle by looking at the images on the monitor.  Through the second incision small instruments, which have various purposes (shaving, scraping, biting etc.) can be placed in the ankle.  This technique can be used to address many different problems of the ankle.<br /><h2>Recovery</h2><br />The recovery after an ankle arthroscopy will depend on the type of surgery performed. Usually one stitch is placed in each incision.  These will be removed in the office in about 2 weeks.  After surgery, some patients will be placed in a surgical boot after and will be allowed to walk immediately.  In other cases a soft cast will be applied and the patient will stay off the leg for a period of time.  This can typically range from 1-6 weeks.  Your orthopaedic surgeon will guide you post-operative process.<br /><h2>Potential General Complications</h2><br /><span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Cambria;">The complication risks from ankle arthroscopy are very low about 3.5%, but can include:</span></span><br /><ul><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#infection">Infection</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems">Wound Healing Problems</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications/#bloodvesselinjury"><em><strong>Blood Vessel Injury</strong></em></a></li><br />	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications/#nerve-injury"><em><strong>Nerve Injury</strong></em></a></li><br />	<li>Breakage of Insruments in the Ankle</li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#dvt">Deep Vein Thrombosis</a> <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications/#dvt">(Blood Clot)</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong> <a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#pe">Pulmonary Embolism (PE)</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications/#crps"><em><strong>Complex Regional Pain Syndrome</strong></em></a></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#continued-pain">Failure to Resolve ALL Symptoms</a> </strong></em></li><br /></ul><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Common-Questions-for-Ankle-Arthroscopy.pdf"><em><strong>Click here for a more detailed review of Ankle Arthroscopy.</strong></em></a><br /><p> Edited January 7, 2016</p>
Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/paul-juliano-md-editor/">Paul Juliano, MD</a></strong></em><br /><h2>Indications</h2><br />Ankle fracture surgery is indicated for patients who suffer a displaced <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/unstable-ankle-fracture">unstable ankle fracture</a></strong></em> involving either the bone on the inside of the ankle (the medial malleolus), the bone on the outside of the ankle (the lateral malleolus which is also known as the fibula), or both.  The procedure is often described as an ankle fracture open reduction internal fixation (ORIF).The ankle is not a joint that tolerates any displacement as this will lead to uneven loading of the ankle joint, and the subsequent development of <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-arthritis">ankle arthritis</a></strong></em> (loss of joint cartilage) in a short period of time.  If an ankle fracture has lead to a displaced or unstable ankle joint, (Figure 1) then surgery is indicated for most patients (some high risk patients may not be surgical candidates). If the fracture causes the lower bone of the ankle joint (talus) to be displaced by 1 millimeter or more the joint surface of the ankle will be “mismatched” and ankle arthritis will tend to develop over time.<br /><h4>Syndesmosis Injury</h4><br />One injury that may occur in conjunction with an ankle fracture is a disruption of the syndesmosis. A syndesmostic injury is a disruption of the strong fibrous ligaments that hold the fibula and tibia together, near the ankle joint. If the syndesmosis is disrupted, then the ankle joint will be unstable and surgery is usually indicated.<br /><h5>Figure 1: Displaced fibular fracture with displaced ankle joint</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Ankle-Fracture-ORIF-Figure-1.jpg">^media_display_589c29c4de9125bcb7693169/position:center^</a><br /><h2>Procedures</h2><br /><h4>Lateral Malleolus Fracture (Distal Fibula Fracture)</h4><br />To fix a fracture on the outside of the ankle, (lateral malleolus fracture) an incision is made on the outside of the ankle, essentially along the line of the fibula (the prominent bone on the outside of the ankle). The soft-tissues (tendons, muscles, ligaments) are dissected down to the fracture site. The fracture itself is cleaned up (ex. clotted blood is removed) and the bones are put back together, hopefully in the exact position (anatomic alignment) that they were in prior to the fracture. Once positioned, there are a variety of ways to fix (stabilize) the bones. The most common method is putting a screw across the fracture site for compression. This is followed by a metal plate with a series of screws to hold the fibula in its position (Figure 2).<br /><h5>Figure 2: Lateral Malleolus (Distal Fibula) Fracture after surgery</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Ankle-Fracture-ORIF-Figure-2.jpg">^media_display_589c29c4de9125bcb769316c/position:center^</a><br /><h4>Medial Malleolus Fracture</h4><br />A fracture of the bone on the inside of the ankle (medial malleolus) is approached through an incision on the inside of the ankle. A vertical incision is made and the surgeon dissects down to the fracture site. The fracture is cleaned up, which includes removal of any clotted blood (hematoma) from around the fracture site. Once prepared, the fracture fragments are put back into position with the aim of positioning the bone fragments in the exact position that they were in prior to the fracture. Once positioned the fracture is usually secured with two screws.<br /><h4>Bimalleolar Fracture</h4><br />This procedure involves surgical treatment of both a fractured medial malleolus and lateral malleolus. These two procedures are done separately (two different incisions) but are performed together under the same anesthetic. Like each individual procedure, the goal is to reduce the fractures into the position that they were in prior to the fracture and to ensure that the ankle joint itself is perfectly positioned (anatomically reduced) and stable.<br /><h4>Trimalleolar Fracture</h4><br />This procedure is similar to that used to fix a bimalleolar ankle fracture, except it also involves a fragment in the back aspect (posterior) of the tibia. If the fragment represents less than 20% of the joint suface of the tibia (as viewed on the lateral xray from the side of the joint), then it is disregarded and treated like a bimalleolar fracture. However, if greater than 20%, the fragment needs to be repositioned. Reducing the fragment can be done in a similar process to a lateral malleolus fracture or by making an incision near the back, outside aspect of the ankle. Once reduced, it is usually fixed with a screw or two from the front to the back of the ankle.<br /><h4>Intra-articular injury</h4><br />When an ankle fracture occurs, it is not only the bones that are injured. All the surrounding structures ( tendons, ligaments, muscles, nerves, joint cartilage) also sustain injury, which can vary from minor to permanent. One of these structures, articular cartilage (the cartilage that lines the joint surfaces) can be damaged or scarring can occur within the joint. This can cause ongoing pain that sometimes requires further surgery, such as arthroscopy to look inside the joint.<br /><h4>Stabilizing a Syndesmotic Injury/Disruption</h4><br />If the strong fibrous tissues holding the tibia and fibula together (syndesmosis) is injured (partially torn) or disrupted, (completely torn) it should be repaired. This injury can occur with a fracture of the fibula far away from the ankle joint or without any fracture at all. The surgeon will often assess the stability of the syndesmosis, either before or during surgery, by &quot;stressing&quot; the ankle under fluoroscopy (a portable x-ray) or performing weight bearing xrays (if this is possible) to see if the ankle &quot;opens up&quot; (does the talus shift out of position when stressed). The syndesmosis can sometimes be assessed during an ankle arthroscopy (looking inside the ankle joint with a small camera). If the syndesmosis is determined to be unstable, the syndesmosis is stablized so that it will heal in the desired (reduced) position. The syndesmosis is usually stablized by putting one or two screws across the fibula and into the tibia, in order to stabilize these bones and allow the syndesmosis to heal. After approximately 3-6 months, (once the syndesmosis has healed) the screws are removed. In some situations, the surgeon may choose to repair the syndesmosis directly with strong sutures.<br /><h2>Recovery</h2><br /><em>0-6 weeks Post-Surgery</em>Patients undergoing this type of surgery will typically need about 6 weeks for the bone to heal. During this period, the patient is either in a cast boot or post-operative shoe and remains non-weight bearing or touch weight-bearing through the heel.<em>6-10 (or 12) weeks Post Surgery</em>At 6 weeks post-operatively, patient can begin to increase weight bearing as tolerated in a protective boot.<em>10 (or 12) weeks + Post-Surgery</em>Patients can begin transitioning into a shoe and continue to rehabilitate at this point.<br /><h2>Potential Complications</h2><br /><h4><em>Nerve Injury</em></h4><br />Injury to the Superficial peroneal nerve or the Sural nerve can occur due to the placement of the incisions, specifically for a lateral malleolous fracture. Nerve injury can occur due to retraction, direct injury, or from scarring during the recovery process. If these nerves are injured or cut, the patient could end up with numbness or pain along the path of the nerve (onto the top or outside of the foot).<br /><h4><em>Atrophy</em></h4><br />Due to the lack of movement after the surgery, calf muscles have a potential to atrophy. The calf muscles may take a while to strengthen, which may never reach their full potential prior to surgery.<br /><h4><em>Stiffness</em></h4><br />The capsule surrounding the ankle joint may get stiff, which may decrease the range of motion around the ankle joint.<br /><h4><em>Painful Hardware</em></h4><br />About 15-20% of patients experience pain associated with the screws and plates that are used to secure the bone fragments. These patients will need to undergo removal of the screws due to discomfort, once the bones have healed.<br /><h4><em>Post-Traumatic Ankle Arthritis</em></h4><br />Having an ankle fracture will increase the chances of obtaining <em><strong><a href="/ankle-arthritis">ankle arthritis</a></strong></em>. Ankle arthritis is about 10 times less common than hip or knee arthritis. Most patients who have an ankle fracture will not develop significant arthritis. However, the majority of the patients who develop ankle arthritis have had a significant ankle injury in the past.<br /><h4><em>Failure of Hardware with Syndesmosis</em></h4><br />If the syndesmosis is fixed, there may be a potential for the screws to break at the syndesmosis if they are not taken out early enough. Although it may sound very troubling, the broken screws have no bearing on the patient's symptoms. The potential complication is not considered significant; however, it may interfere with the resolution of an MRI.<br /><h4><em>Failure of Syndesmotic Fixation</em></h4><br />Rarely, after removal of the syndesmotic fixation, an injury may recur if the ligaments have not healed adequately. This may show itself as ongoing pain in the region. Should this happen, it may require further surgery to the region.<br /><h4><em>Venous Thromboembolism</em></h4><br />Some patients may be at risk of venous thromboembolism (clotting) related to the surgery and post-operative immobilisation. Your surgeon may choose to commence anticoagulation (blood thinning medications) after undertaking a risk assessment of your situation.

It is typically indicated in older, lower demand individuals, as the lifespan of the ankle replacement is uncertain. Patients that have arthritis (or fusions) involving the joints below the ankle (subtalar, talonavicular and calcaneocuboid joints), may benefit from an ankle replacement, as it will help to preserve some hindfoot motion. Relatively young, active patients typically do not do well with ankle replacements in the long run due to an unacceptably high failure rate. These younger patients are usually best served with a well performed ankle fusion. The results of ankle replacement, unfortunately, have not matched the results we see in knee and hip replacements.<br /><h5>Figure 1A: Normal Ankle Joint on X-ray</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Ankle-Replacement_Figure-1.jpg">^media_display_589c29c8de9125bcb7693177/position:center^</a><br /><h5>Figure 1B: Ankle Arthritis on X-ray (Loss of ankle joint space)</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Ankle-Replacement_Figure-2.jpg">^media_display_589c29c8de9125bcb769317a/position:center^</a><br /><h2>Procedure</h2><br />The procedure depends on the type of prosthesis that is used. In all ankle replacements, the arthritic surface of the distal tibia is removed, as is the arthritic surface of the top surface talus. <span style="font-family: Calibri;">Typically </span>only the tibial surface and some of the talar dome are removed (Figure 2). The resected areas of bone are then replaced with the prosthesis.  The prosthesis typically has a metal surface on the tibia, and talar sides with a polyethylene surface attached to the tibial component.<br /><h5>Figure 2: Tornier Salos Talaris Total Ankle Replacement</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Ankle-Replacement_Figure-5.jpg">^media_display_589c29c9de9125bcb769317d/position:center^</a><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Ankle-Replacement_Figure-6.jpg">^media_display_589c29cbde9125bcb7693180/position:center^</a><br /><h2>Potential Complications</h2><br />These include the potential complications that can occur with any surgery such as:<br /><ul><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#infection">Infection</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems">Wound healing problems</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#dvt">Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#pe">Pulmonary Embolism (PE)</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#nerve-injury">Nerve Injury</a></strong></em></li><br /></ul><br />There are some specific complications that occur with total ankle replacement including:<strong><em>Deep Infection of the Prosthesis</em></strong>. The deep wound infection rate in patients undergoing Total Ankle Replacement is not necessarily any higher than with other major ankle surgery, however, the significance of a deep infection is profound. A deep infection often requires removal of the prosthesis in order to eradicate the infection. The deep infection rate is approximately 1-3%.<em><strong>Major Wound Breakdown</strong>.</em> Most total ankle replacements are inserted through an incision in the front of the ankle. This area of tissue has a somewhat tenuous blood supply. It is supplied by one main artery, whereas most other areas of the body are supplied by two or more major arteries. For this reason, some difficulty with wound healing occurs at a much higher rate in patients undergoing total ankle replacement. Often, this requires immobilizing the ankle for a few weeks to improve the chances of successful wound healing.  In some patients, however, an area of wound breakdown or a failure to heal the surgical incision occurs. This can be a difficult and potentially devastating complication because the failure to obtain adequate wound healing can lead to a deep infection involving the prosthesis.<strong><em>Tibial Nerve Injury</em></strong>. There is a chance of an injury to the surrounding nerves, including the tibial nerve, when the ankle joint is prepared to receive the ankle prosthesis.<strong><em>Failure of the Ankle Replacement over time</em></strong>. All joint replacements will eventually fail if the patient uses the joint enough, and lives long enough. There are a variety of ways that joint replacements can fail, each of which lead to pain and dysfunction. Perhaps the most common mode of failure of a joint replacement is from shifting of the prosthesis, when the supporting bone becomes weak from repetitive loading or osteolysis, breakdown of the bone under the prosthesis resulting from a reaction of the immune system to very small particles of the polyethylene section of the prosthesis.Total ankle replacements historically have failed earlier, and at a substantially higher rate, when compared to knee and hip replacements. For example, studies have suggested that certain hip replacements have good or excellent results in over 90% of patients after 18 years. In knee replacements, the figures are close to 90% success after an average of 13 years. However, in ankle replacements, the best prospective study suggests that 85% of patients have a successful result after 5 years - not bad, but no where near as successful as knee and hip replacement surgery.Ankle replacements fail at a higher rate because of a variety of factors related to the ankle joint itself. These include:<br /><ul><br />	<li>the small joint surface area (half the size of the knee joint)</li><br />	<li>high joint reactive forces during walking (2-4 x body weight, almost twice that of the knee joint)</li><br />	<li>Uneven distribution of force across the tibial prosthesis</li><br />	<li>The lower bone of the ankle (Talus) is relatively small and has a poor blood supply, providing a less than ideal base of support for the prosthesis.</li><br />	<li>There are limits to how much bone can be removed from the ankle joint, and this limits the size of polyethylene that can be used. The smaller the polyethylene, the poorer the wear characteristics</li><br />	<li>The relatively confined nature (many important structures nearby) of the ankle joint makes placing an ankle replacement technically challenging for the surgeon.</li><br /></ul><br />When an ankle joint fails, a revision surgery is necessary. Often the prosthesis can be replaced. However, there is much less bone stock available around the ankle, so revision surgery is often substantially more difficult with results that are less predictable than the original operation. If the prosthesis cannot be replaced, the ankle joint is then fused, but studies show that patients who have an ankle fusion after a failed ankle replacement do poorer than patient who have an ankle fusion first.<br /><p>Edited February 29, 2016</p>
<h2>Indications:</h2><br />A Chevron osteotomy is indicated for correction of a mild to moderate hallux valgus deformity. This allows for a small reduction of the angle between the first and second metatarsal. It is ideal for bunions that are not particularly pronounced.<br /><h2>Procedure:</h2><br />The procedure involves a V-shaped cut in the distal aspect of the first metatarsal, near the metatarsal head (See Figure 1). This allows the distal aspect of the bone to be translated between 45 mm in the lateral direction (See Figure 2).  The cut bone is then fixed in this position with a small screw or a suture of some sort. The excess bone on the inside of the foot (medial side) is then resected. The joint capsule is also tightened to allow for correction of the bunion (link to 1st MTP medial Capsulorraphy).<br /><h4>Figure 1</h4><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Osteotomy-chevron-distal_figure-1.jpg">^media_display_589c29cdde9125bcb7693185/position:center^</a> <br /><h4>Figure 2</h4><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Osteotomy-chevron-distal_figure-2.jpg">^media_display_589c29cede9125bcb7693188/position:center^</a> <br /><h2>Recovery Time:</h2><br />Patients undergoing a chevron osteotomy are often allowed to walk, as long as they are in a stiff soled shoe and they mostly walk with weight through their heel. They do need to limit their activity in the postoperative period, as excessive activity can lead to a nonunion or a malunion. Patients can usually be advanced to a more normal shoe at 6 weeks. However, it will often be 3-4 months before they have made 80% of their recovery, and often 9-12 months before their maximal recovery is achieved. Patients recovering from a chevron osteotomy (or other foot surgeries) can have persistent swelling. This can carry on for a number of months following surgery. This is due to increased blood flow as part of the healing process.<br /><h2>Potential Complications:</h2><br />The usual list of general post-surgical complications may occur with a Chevron osteotomy. This includes the potential for:<em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems">Wound healing Problems </a></strong></em><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#infection">Infection</a></strong></em><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#non-union">Nonunion</a></strong></em><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#nerve-injury">Local nerve injury </a></strong></em><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#dvt">Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) </a></strong></em><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#pe">Pulmonary Embolism (PE)</a></strong></em><br /><h2>Specific Complications:</h2><br />Complications that are specific to Chevron osteotomy include:<br /><ul><br />	<li><em>Malunion</em>: This can occur when the bone either is not positioned correctly resulting in abnormal position of the toe, or when the position of the osteotomy changes following surgery. In this instance, the toe may be malpositioned even to the point where further surgery is required.</li><br />	<li><em>Avascular necrosis of the metatarsal head</em>: This occurs when there is a loss of blood supply to the metatarsal head.

<h2>Procedure</h2><br />This procedure involves fusing (or &quot;soldering&quot;) the great toe joint (first MTP joint) together. The goal of surgery is to make the great joint solidly aligned and immobile.  This relieves much of the pain since motion through the arthritic joint is eliminated. Great toe fusion is typically performed in patients who already have significant arthritis of the 1st MTP joint (late stage or severe <em><strong><a href="/hallux-rigidus-hallux-limitus">hallux rigidus</a></strong></em>). It can also be successfully used, however, as a salvage procedure for patients with severe bunion deformities (<em><strong><a href="/bunions-hallux-valgus">hallux valgus</a></strong></em>).To fuse the great toe joint, any remnant cartilage on the arthritic joint surface is removed and the underlying bone is prepared for fusion. The joint is positioned in a manner which maximizes walking ability and maintains acceptable clinical alignment. This is traditionally done with the toe positioned so that it just gently touches the ground in a weight bearing position. The fused joint is typically fixated with two or three screws (Figure 1), although alternatively, a plate may be used to stabilize the joint.<br /><h5>Figure 1: Typical Great Toe fusion with screws</h5><br />^media_display_589c29cfde9125bcb769318c/position:center^<br /><h2>Recovery</h2><br />Depending upon the age and overall health status of the patient, recovery requires a period of 6 to 12 weeks to allow for adequate healing. During this time, it may be possible to bear some weight through the heel, provided a cast or a stiff soled boot (ex. <em><strong><a href="/cam-walker-walking-boot">Cam Walker</a></strong></em>) is used. The exact recovery plan will be determined by the surgeon and by the quality of the patient's bone. Following a period of early healing (usually 6 weeks), patients are able to increase their activity level and transition to a stiff-soled shoe with a wide-toe box.  Post-operative compliance with any weight-bearing and/or physiotherapy protocol is critical to avoid failure of fixation (hardware), loss of alignment, or <em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#non-union">non-union</a></strong></em>, all of which can result in the need for further revision surgery if they occur.<br /><h2>Potential General Complications</h2><br /><p><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems">Wound Healing Problems</a></strong></em><br /><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#infection">Infection</a></strong></em><br /><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#nerve-injury">Local nerve injury</a></strong></em><br /><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#non-union">Non-Union</a></strong></em></p><h2>Potential Specific Complications</h2><br /><h3>Malposition of the joint</h3><br />Malposition of the joint is a possible complication due to the difficulty the surgeon may have in determining the most appropriate position, in which the joint should be fused. Malposition of the great toe fusion is a relatively uncommon complication. However, sometimes even subtle malposition of the great toe can create symptoms because the great toe is subject to a disproportionate amount of force during walking. In the rare cases that this occurs, it can often be rectified by repositioning the toe with further surgery.<br /><h3>Nonunion of the joint</h3><br />Nonunion is probably more common than malunion (malposition) for the 1st MTP fusion. This is because the joint itself is very small. Therefore, the area across which we are expecting bone to heal is also small. In the event that a patient is unable to successfully bridge this area with mature bone and it remains symptomatic, a revision procedure fusion with increased hardware and perhaps some bone graft can usually be effective in getting the area to heal completely.<br /><p>Edited January 24, 2017</p><br /><p><span style="font-size: 10px;"><br /></span></p>
<h2>Indications:</h2><br />The Lapidus procedure is used to correct a moderate to severe hallux valgus deformity.  It is also indicated for hallux valgus associated with a hypermobility of the first ray.<br /><h2>Procedure:</h2><br />The procedure involves an incision over the dorsomedial (top and inside) part of the midfoot. The first tarsometatarsal joint is exposed. This joint is then prepared for fusion. In the context of fusing this joint, the angle between the first and second metatarsal is decreased. This joint is then typically fused with two screws. It may also be fused with a plate if it is applied appropriately. In addition, the bunion is corrected through a medial incision over the great toe. which allows the joint capsule to be tightened, as well as the prominent medial bone associated with the bunion to be removed. As well, it is often necessary to perform a release of the tightened structures on the lateral (outside) part of the great toe joint.<br /><h2>Recovery Time:</h2><br />This procedure requires a period of 6 weeks of non weight-bearing or limited weight-bearing through the heel. The joint that is fused needs to heal, and therefore load through the mid part of the foot has to be quite limited during this time. Once this joint has started to heal at about the 6-week mark, patients can be mobilized in a stiff-soled shoe or a walking boot. Usually, they are able to return to a regular shoe by 9-12 weeks post surgery. It is common to need to splint the great toe in its corrected position, either with a toe spacer between the first and second toe or sometimes even with a bunion splint.<br /><h2>Potential Complications:</h2><br />The general surgical complications can occur with a Lapidus procedure.

Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/peter-stavrou-md-editor/">Peter Stavrou, MD</a></strong></em><br /><h2>Indications</h2><br />A proximal metatarsal osteotomy is indicated for patients with a moderate to severe bunion deformity that has failed non-surgical management.<br /><h2>Procedure</h2><br />The first metatarsal is cut near the base of the bone and rotated. There are several types of proximal metatarsal osteotomies, all of which have the same goal of reducing the angle between the first and second metatarsal (also known as the &quot;intermetatarsal angle&quot;):<br /><ul><br />	<li><strong><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ludloff-procedure-bunion-surgery">Ludloff osteotomy</a></em></strong>: an oblique cut is made along the side of the shaft of the first metatarsal, and rotated to reduce the angle</li><br />	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/cresentic-osteotomy-bunion-correction"><em>Cresentic osteotomy</em></a></strong>: a semi-circular cut is made back along the base of the first metatarsal, and rotated to reduce the angle</li><br />	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/scarf-osteotomy"><em>SCARF osteotomy</em></a></strong>: a Z shaped cut is made from the side of the first metatarsal, using most of it’s length to give it a more stable configuration. The bone is then moved and / or rotated to reduce the angle.</li><br /></ul><br />There are several other types of proximal metatarsal osteotomies, such as the proximal closing wedge osteotomy, the proximal chevron osteotomy, and the medial chevron opening wedge osteotomy, all of which have the same goal of reducing the intermetatarsal angle.Along with this procedure, the bunion (part of the metatarsal head) is also shaved off to make it less prominent and narrow the foot. A soft tissue procedure is performed on the first metatarsophalangeal joint, which releases the tight soft tissue structures on the lateral side  of the first metatarsal (near the second toe) and tightens up the soft tissues on the medial side (over the bunion). This helps to correct the bunion deformity. This type of procedure is called the McBride Procedure.<br /><h2>Recovery</h2><br />During the first 6 weeks, the bone heals and patients are either limited or non-weight bearing depending on the complexity of their problem or surgeon preference. After an x-ray verifies that the bones have healed, the patient can advance to weight bearing, as tolerated in a protective shoe. Also after the 6 week mark, aggressive physical therapy is done to maintain or achieve as much motion as possible in the first metatarsal. By the 8-12 week mark, the patient can then transition into a stiff sole shoe.During the first four months, 75% recovery is gained; however, it can be up to a year for maximal improvement. It's important after the initial swelling has settled, for the first metatarsal to be splinted in its corrected position and gently moved at the same time, so that stiffness is minimized.<br /><h2>General Complications</h2><br /><ul><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems">Wound Healing Problem</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#infection">Infection</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#dvt">Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#pe">Pulmonary Embolism (PE)</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#asymmetric-gait">Altered Gait</a></strong></em></li><br /></ul><br /><h2>Specific Complications</h2><br /><ul><br />	<li><em>Malunion</em> (Bone heals in the wrong position): If a malunion occurs, pain is concentrated on other parts of the foot.

Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/michael-castro-do-editor" target="_blank">Michael Castro, DO</a></strong></em><br /><h2>Indications</h2><br />A calcaneal osteotomy comprises cutting the heel bone and shifting it toward the inside (medial) or outside (lateral). A calcaneal osteotomy is indicated for patients whose hindfoot alignment is significantly offset and for whom non-operative management has failed. Alignment of the heel influences how weight-bearing stress is applied to the foot, ankle, knee and hip. Depending on which way the hindfoot is offset, the heel (calcaneus) may be shifted towards the midline of the body (medializing calcaneal osteotomy), or away from the midline of the body (lateralizing calcaneal osteotomy). For example, a patient with <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/acquired-adult-flatfoot-deformity-posterior-tibial-tendon-dysfunction"><strong><em>acquired adult flatfoot deformity</em></strong></a> will often have the heel offset to the outside and may benefit from a medializing calcaneal osteotomy to shift the hindfoot to the inside and change the way load is distributed through the heel (Figure 1). On the other hand, a patient with a high arched foot (cavus foot pattern) often has a heel that is offset to the inside (Figure 2). Individuals with a high arched foot may have symptoms ranging from pain along the lateral or outside half of the foot, to wearing out of the inside (medial) portion of the ankle joint. With this structural alignment, individuals are predisposed to <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/sprained-ankle"><strong><em>sprain their ankle</em></strong></a> and may develop <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-instability"><strong><em>ankle instability</em></strong></a>. In severe forms of ankle instability, a lateralizing calcaneal osteotomy to shift the heel to the outside and re-establish a more normal hindfoot alignment may be beneficial.<br /><h5>Figure 1: Heel shifted to the outside in Flatfoot Deformity</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Calcaneal-Osteotomy_Figure-1.jpg">^media_display_589c29d0de9125bcb7693192/position:center^</a>Figure 2: Both heels shifted to the inside in high arched foot<a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Calcaneal-Osteotomy_Figure-2.jpg">^media_display_589c29d0de9125bcb7693195/position:center^</a><br /><h2>Procedure</h2><br />An oblique incision is made on the outside region of the heel and is dissected down to the bone, which is about 5-10mm under the skin. One precaution while exposing the bone is to avoid cutting or injuring the sural nerve which provides sensation to the outside part of the foot. Once exposed, the back part of the heel bone is cut (osteotomy) into two pieces. The back part of the bone is then either shifted towards (medially) or away from (laterally) the midline. The bone is shifted between 5-12mm (1/4-1/2&quot;). After the bone is shifted, it is fixed in place usually with 1 or 2 large screws to stabilize the heel in its new position (see Figure 3). When the bone is shifted, a sharp edge is created, which is smoothed out prior to closing the wound.<br /><h5>Figure 3: Calcaneal Osteotomy (Side and Bottom View)</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Calcaneal-Osteotomy_Figure-3.jpg">^media_display_589c29d1de9125bcb7693198/position:center^</a><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Calcaneal-Osteotomy_Figure-4.jpg">^media_display_589c29d2de9125bcb769319b/position:center^</a><br /><h2>Recovery</h2><br /><em>0-6 weeks Post-Surgery</em><br />Patients undergoing this type of surgery will typically need about 6 weeks for the bone to heal. During this period, the patient is either in a cast or a cast boot and remains non-weight bearing or touch weight-bearing.<em>6-12 weeks Post-Surgery</em><br />After the 6-week period of non weight bearing, x-rays will usually be taken. If healing is documented, the patient can begin weight-bearing in a cast boot (<a href="http://www.footeducation.com/cam-walker-walking-boot"><strong><em>Cam Walker</em></strong></a> or equivalent) as tolerated. During the next 2-6 weeks, patients can gradually increase the amount of walking (number of steps per day) that they doing. After the foot has accommodated to bearing weight in the CAM walker, weight bearing progresses incrementally (adding 20 to 30 pounds every day or every other day) in a supportive running or walking shoe. Supervised physical therapy is an important part of the recovery process. It is often 8-12 weeks post-op before the patient is in a shoe 100% of the day.Calcaneal osteotomies are often combined with other procedures, such as <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/tendon-transfers">tendon transfers</a>, so the actual recovery time may vary depending on the procedures that are performed. In general, during the first 5-6 months, patients generally get about 75-80% of their recovery. However, it commonly takes a year or more for full recovery since it takes a long time for all of the swelling to settle and the bones to remodel.<br /><h2>Potential Complications</h2><br /><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems">Wound Healing Problems</a></strong></em><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#infection">Wound Infection</a></strong></em><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#dvt">Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)</a></strong></em><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#pe">Pulmonary embolism (PE)</a></strong></em><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#crps">Complex regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS)</a></strong></em><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#asymmetric-gait">Asymmetric Gait</a></strong></em><br /><h2>Specific potential complications</h2><br />Complications specific to this surgery include:<br /><ul><br /><ul><br />	<li><em>Sural nerve and medial calcaneal nerve injury</em>: Injury to the sural nerve on the outside of the heel can occur during the procedure, either due to retraction, or direct injury; or from scarring during the recovery period.

<h2>Indications</h2><br />This type of procedure is indicated for patients with a high-arched foot, which can lead to a variety of critical problems, including recurring <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/sprained-ankle">ankle sprains</a></strong></em>, <em><strong><a href="/ankle-instability">ankle instability</a></strong></em>, <em><strong><a href="/peroneal-tendonitis">peroneal tendonitis</a></strong></em>, <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/5th-metatarsal-base-fractures">5th metatarsal stress fractures</a></strong></em>, and <em><strong><a href="/sesamoiditis">sesamoiditis</a></strong></em>. Ususally, most conditions can be treated without surgery by either modifying activities, using various shoe inserts, and doing physical therapy exercises. However, surgical reconstruction, which may include a dorsiflexed  osteotomy, may be beneficial for some patients where non-operative management has failedA common condition that leads to this type of surgery is <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-cmt-foot-deformities">Charcot-Marie Tooth disease</a></strong></em>, a condition where patients develop high-arched feet that can lead to significant symptoms.One of the main features of a high-arched foot is a plantarflexed first metatarsal, where the big toe is angled down more than the other toes. Therefore, this surgery is intended to correct the position of the first metatarsal. This surgery is often done in conjunction with other surgical procedures to fix a high arched foot.<br /><h2>Procedure</h2><br />An incision is made over the top of the first metatarsal and dissected down to the bone. Once the top and side regions of the toe are exposed, a wedge of bone is removed. The toe is then repositioned upward to reduce the high-arch, and secured with screws, plates, or staples (Figure 1).<br /><h5>Figure 1A &amp; 1B: Removal of bone to reposition the big toe upwards and thereby alter the loading on the base of the big toe</h5><br />^media_display_589c29d3de9125bcb769319f/position:center^[Content: /wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Dorsiflexed-1st-Ray-AP-Resized.jpg Goes Here]<br /><h2>Recovery</h2><br /><em>0-6 weeks Post-Surgery</em><br />Patients undergoing this type of surgery will typically need about 6 weeks for the bone to heal. During this period, the patient is either in a cast boot or in a post-operative shoe, and remains non-weight bearing or touch weight-bearing through the heel.<em>6 weeks + Post-Surgery</em><br />At 6 weeks postoperatively, if x-rays demonstrates satisfactory healing, patients are then allowed to begin weight-bearing in a Cam Walker or a stiff soled shoe, as tolerated.Patients will gain approximately 75-80% of recovery in 4-5 months. However, it may take over a year to reach the point of maximal improvement.<br /><h2>Potential General Complications</h2><br /><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems">Wound Healing Problem</a></strong></em><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#infection">Infection</a></strong></em><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#dvt">Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)</a></strong></em><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#pe">Pulmonary Embolism (PE)</a></strong></em><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#asymmetric-gait">Asymmetric Gait</a></strong></em><br /><h2>Potential Specific Complications</h2><br /><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#non-union"><em>Nonunion</em></a></strong><br />A nonunion occurs when the fusion site fails to adequately fuse together. If a patient does have a nonunion or a delayed union, they may require a longer period of non weight-bearing, and in some instances will require revision surgery. The typical nonunion rate is about 5%. Risk factors include the surgical technique, the patient's underlying condition, whether the patient smokes cigarettes, and the patient's compliance with the postoperative non weight-bearing protocol.<strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#nerve-injury"><em>Nerve Injury</em></a></strong><br />Injury to the nerve on the outside aspect of the 1st metatarsal (deep peroneal nerve), or on the inside aspect of the first metatarsal (medial branch of the superficial peroneal nerve), can occur due to the placement of the incisions.

There are a variety of foot fractures that may need surgical treatment. These include the following fractures, which may be treated with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF):<br /><ul><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/calcaneal-fracture-orif">Calcanel Fracture ORIF</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/lisfranc-fracture-orif">Lisfranc Fracture ORIF</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/pilon-fracture-orif">Pilon Fracture ORIF</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/talar-neck-fracture-orif">Talar Neck ORIF</a></strong></em></li><br /></ul><br /><p>Edited May 30, 2015</p>
<a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/matthew-buchanan-md-editor/">Edited by Matthew Buchanan, MD</a><br /><h2>Indications</h2><br />The term “ORIF” stands for “open reduction, internal fixation”.  Quite simply, the surgeon opens the fracture site, puts the fractured bone back together then, uses plates and/or screws to stabilize the broken bone pieces.  The main indication for this type of surgery on the heel bone (<em><strong><a href="/calcaneal-fracture">calcaneus fracture</a></strong></em>) is a displaced fracture. Displaced means the bone fragments are “out of position” and must be put back together.  By putting these broken pieces back together, orthopaedic surgeons hope to maximize the functional outcome.  However, not all patients with calcaneal fractures are candidates for surgery.  Certain fractures are not displaced enough to need surgery.  And for other patients, the risk of a serious complication (such as a deep infection) may outweigh the potential benefits of surgery. It is often the judgment of the surgeon (after discussion with the patient) to determine the best treatment method.<br /><h2>Procedure</h2><br />The goal of calcaneal fracture ORIF is to place the bones back to their original position prior to the injury.  By restoring the normal alignment, the surgeon hopes to provide the patient with the best possible outcome.  The final outcome often depends on the severity of the initial injury.  Simple fracture patterns with minimal displacement and large bone pieces are easier to treat than highly complex fractures involving many small pieces.  During surgery, these small pieces all need to be carefully placed in their original position.  This challenging endeavor is equivalent to putting a broken eggshell back together.During surgery, the patient is usually positioned on his or her side. The incision is made on the outside (lateral) aspect of the foot.  Your surgeon will determine the type and shape of this incision.  Once the skin incision is made, your surgeon will carefully move important tendons and ligaments out of the way in an effort to visualize the underlying calcaneus bone.  Once the bone is exposed, your surgeon will make an effort to inspect the subtalar joint.  The subtalar joint, which is often injured in calcaneus fractures, is the joint below your ankle that controls the “side-to-side” (inversion and eversion) motion of your foot.Once the surgical exposure is complete, the process of systematically reassembling the bone pieces is started. There are usually two primary fragments of the fractured calcaneus.  These fragments are realigned first and temporarily fixed with wires to hold them in place.  Proper alignment is confirmed by the use of a live x-ray machine (called a C-arm).  Next, the subtalar joint surface is reconstructed by systematically repositioning all other fracture fragments.  Once the calcaneal alignment is restored, the temporary wires are sequentially removed and replaced with permanent hardware, such as plates and/or screws (Figure 1A and 1B).The final step involves closure of the surgical wound.  In some ways, this is the most important part of the surgical procedure because any breakdown of the wound will increase the risk of a significant post-operative infection.  Once the wound closure is complete, a soft cast (called a splint) is applied to the leg.<br /><h5>Figure 1A: Fractured Calcaneus</h5><br />^media_display_589c29d9de9125bcb76931a4/position:center^<br /><h5>Figure 1B: Fixed Calcaneal Fracture</h5><br />^media_display_589c29d9de9125bcb76931a7/position:center^<br /><h2>Recovery</h2><br /><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Week 0-2 Post Surgery</span></em>The foot is immobilized in the soft cast (splint), iced and elevated.  Your surgeon will ask that you not place any weight on your foot (non weight-bearing).  This will require the use of a wheelchair, walker, knee scooter and/or crutches.  You will likely require prescription-strength pain pills.   Over-the-counter laxatives and stool softeners maybe be required to prevent or treat constipation.  Your dressing should remain clean and dry.  Do not change your dressing unless instructed by your surgeon.<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Week 2-6 Post Surgery</span></em>At your first post-operative visit, your doctor will remove your splint and examine your incision.  Sutures may need to be removed.  You will be placed into a removable boot.  For most calcaneus fractures, your surgeon will ask that you remain non weight-bearing until the fracture demonstrates adequate healing.  If you are placed in removable boot, your surgeon may ask that you start a gentle range-of-motion program.<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Week 6-12 Post Surgery</span></em>During this time period, you are working to improve the range of motion of your foot and ankle.  This may involve visits to a physical therapist combined with a home exercise program.  Your surgeon may also allow you to gradually increase your weight-bearing forces.   At the end of this time period, if the fracture shows evidence of solid healing, your surgeon may allow you to transition out of the boot and into an ankle brace.  The ankle brace will require the use of a wide, stable and comfortable shoe.<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Week 12-24 Post Surgery</span></em>Once the bone has completely healed, you will begin more advanced physical therapy activities (such as walking without a limp and improving your balance strength).  You will see a gradual reduction of swelling, although expect your foot/ankle to remain swollen for many months after surgery.  Full recovery from these challenging injuries often takes 6-12 months.<br /><h2>Potential General Complications</h2><br /><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#asymmetric-gait">Asymmetric Gait (leading to pain elsewhere)</a></strong></em><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#dvt">Deep Vein Thrombosis</a></strong></em><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#continued-pain">Failure to Resolve ALL Symptoms</a></strong></em><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#pe">Pulmonary Embolism (PE)</a></strong></em><br /><h2>Potential Specific Complications</h2><br /><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems">Wound Healing Problems</a></strong>: </em>Although seen with any surgical procedure, wound healing complications are particularly concerning following calcaneal fracture surgery. The area around the outside of the heel has relatively thin skin and limited soft-tissue coverage. This can make wound healing problems more likely following calcaneal fracture surgery, and potentially more severe if they do develop. Wound healing problems are increased significantly for smokers and diabetics.<em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#infection">Infection</a></strong>: </em>Infections can create a major problem if they occur following a calcaneal fracture. As a result of the limited soft-tissue covering the outside of the heel, a superficial wound infection can quickly spread down to the underlying bone.  If an infection develops, your surgeon may recommend the use of oral or intravenous antibiotics.  A repeat trip to the operating room may be required.<em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#nerve-injury">Sural Nerve Injury</a></strong>: </em>Injury to the nerve on the outside of the heel (sural nerve) can occur during calcaneal fracture surgery. Nerve injury can occur due to retraction, direct injury, or from scarring during the recovery process. If the sural nerve is injured or cut, the patient may experience numbness or pain along the path of the nerve.<em><strong>Subtalar Arthritis</strong>: </em>Painful subtalar arthritis and stiffness of the hindfoot is common following calcaneal fracture surgery. This occurs as a result of the damage to the cartilage at the time of the initial injury.<em><strong>Painful Hardware</strong>: </em>Pain may be associated with the screws and plates used to align and secure the broken bone fragments.  This occurs in about 10-20% of patients who have had surgical stabilization of a calcaneus fracture.  Your doctor will help you determine if hardware removal is required.<br /><p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Ed</span><span style="font-size: x-small;">ited</span><em><span style="font-size: x-small;"> April 4, 2015<br /></span></em></p>

The main indication for this ORIF of the Lisfranc joints is a displaced or unstable <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/lisfranc-injury-fracture-midfoot-sprain">Lisfranc fracture</a></strong></em>, or a dislocation. The purpose of the surgery is to reposition the bones and joints in the mid-part of the foot, allowing the associated torn ligaments (the strong tissues that hold these bones together and support the arch) to heal.<br /><h5>Figure 1: Lisfranc Joints</h5><br />[Content: /wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Figure-1A-Lisfranc-Joint_thumb1.jpg Goes Here]<br /><h2>Procedure</h2><br />The location of the incision is dictated by both the location of the fracture and the location of the joints that are disrupted. If all five of the Lisfranc joints are disrupted, then two or three incisions on the top of the foot may be needed; one on the top inside and inside border of the foot, and one on the top outside of the foot. If the first three tarsometatarsal joints are disrupted, then only one or two incisions are made on the top and/or inside aspect of the foot.Once the disrupted tarsometatarsal joints are identified, the dissection is carried down to the involved joints and the debris is cleaned out. The disrupted joints are repositioned back to the position they were in prior to the injury. The joints are then fixed with strong screws. However, if the fragmentation is excessive, a plate may be required (Figure 2). One exception is a disruption of the 4th and 5th tarsometatarsal joints; in this case, the bone is provisionally fixed with wires. The wires are then removed after about six weeks so that some movement of these joints can be encouraged.<br /><h5>Figure 2</h5><br /><h3>[Content: /wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Figure-3-Lisfranc-ORIF_thumb1.jpg Goes Here]</h3><br /><h2>Recovery</h2><br />Recovery from surgery to fix a Lisfranc fracture, subluxation, or dislocation can vary depending on the severity of the original injury, and the stability of the fixation. However, a typical recovery might include:<em>0-6 (or 8) weeks Post-Surgery</em><br />The patient is non-weight bearing to allow for adequate healing of the bones and of the disrupted ligaments. The ligaments actually require a longer time to heal.<em>6 (or 8) - 10 (or 14) weeks Post-Surgery</em><br />The patient can begin to weight-bear as tolerated, provided the foot is protected in a walking boot, such as a CAM walker. This boot (characterized by a rigid sole and a rocker-bottom contour) serves to disperse the force away from the middle of the foot and up the leg.<em>10 (or 14) + Post-Surgery</em><br />At the 10-14 week mark, the patient can then transition into a stiff soled shoe.A displaced injury takes a number of months of recovery. For most Lisfranc injuries, about 70% of the recovery occurs in the first 6 months, but it is often a year or more before our patient has reached their point of maximal improvement following a significant Lisfranc injury.<br /><h2>Potential General Complications</h2><br /><ul><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#asymmetric-gait">Asymmetric Gait (leading to pain elsewhere)</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications/#dvt">Deep Vein Thrombosis (Blood Clot)</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#continued-pain">Failure to Resolve ALL Symptoms</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#pe">Pulmonary Embolism (PE)</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems">Wound Healing Problems</a></strong></em></li><br /></ul><br /><h2><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #000000; font-size: 17px; line-height: 25px;">Potential Specific Complications</span></h2><br /><ul><br />	<li><em><strong>Nerve Injury</strong>. </em>Injury to the nerves between the 1st and 2nd metatarsals (deep peroneal nerve), and on the top inside aspect of the 1st metatarsal (medial branch of the superficial peroneal nerve), can occur due to the placement of the incisions.

<h2>Indications</h2><br />Patients who have suffered a displaced Pilon (Plafond) fracture often benefit from surgery to reposition the bones that make up the top part of the ankle joint.  The goal of surgery is ideally to put the bones back into the position that they were in prior to the injury.  This can be a very challenging operation because the fracture involves the weight-bearing portion of the ankle joint itself, and the bones are often broken into a number of pieces.  Patients that are healthy and do not have any contraindication for surgery are likely to benefit from this procedure if they have suffered a significantly displaced Pilon fracture.<br /><h2>Procedure</h2><br />Initial treatment often involves letting the soft tissue that surrounds the ankle settle.  Operating through swollen, angry, soft tissue may increase the chance of having a wound complication.  However, if the soft tissues are acceptable or if the swelling has settled, the procedure is performed by exposing the fracture site.  It is often necessary to use two or more incisions in order to adequately reposition the fracture fragments and stabilize them with plates and screws.  The actual location of the incisions may vary depending on the fracture site, but often includes an incision at the front and inside part (anteromedial) of the ankle, as well as the front outside part (anterolateral) of the ankle.  The surgeon will rebuild the broken ankle joint one piece at a time, stabilizing them initially provisionally with wires, and then eventually definitively with screws and a plate(s).  In some instances, it may be necessary to bone graft the fracture if there is a significant defect that is left after the fracture has been reduced.<br /><h2>Recovery</h2><br />The recovery from this type of injury and the associated surgery is long.  It is often 12 weeks before there is enough bone healing to begin any sort of weight bearing.  Until the bone is adequately healed, the patient will need to be relatively immobilized, often in a cast.  During this time, movement of the knee and toes can be instituted.  Once the fracture has healed, rehabilitation is oriented toward regaining motion in the ankle joint; rebuilding the muscles of the lower leg; and working on balance and gait retraining.  This can take many months of formal and informal physical therapy.  It is not uncommon for it to take 18 months or more to reach the point of maximum improvement following this type of injury.<br /><h2>Potential Complications</h2><br /><strong>Specific Complications </strong><br /><ul><br />	<li><i>Posttraumatic <strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-arthritis">ankle arthritis</a></strong></i>.  Invariably there will be some arthritis of the ankle joint, and with bad Pilon fracture this arthritis can be extensive, leading to pain and swelling in the ankle joint.  Successful surgery to reduce the fracture will help minimize the extent of arthritis, but it cannot eliminate the formation of arthritis when there has been significant damage to the joint.</li><br />	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems"><i>Wound healing issues</i></a></strong>:  Often there is significant swelling around the ankle following this type of injury.  There is relatively limited soft tissue around the ankle.  This can make the tissue scarred and can predispose to wound healing problems.</li><br />	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#nerve-injury"><i>Nerve injuries</i></a></strong>:  There are five nerves that run across the ankle and any of these may be irritated, leading to numbness or a burning sensation over the nerve distribution.</li><br /></ul><br /><strong>General Complications</strong><br /><ul><br />	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#infection"><i>Infection</i></a></strong></li><br />	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#dvt"><i>Blood clotting</i></a></strong></li><br />	<li><i><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/painful-hardware">Painful retained hardware</a></strong>.  </i>It may be necessary to remove painful hardware once the bones have healed adequately.</li><br /></ul><br /><p align="right">Edited August 5, 2015</p><br /> 
Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/daniel-guss-md-2/">Daniel Guss, MD, M.B.A.</a></strong></em><br /><h2>Indications</h2><br />A talar neck fracture ORIF is indicated for patients with a <em><strong><a href="/talar-neck-fracture">talar neck fracture</a> </strong></em>the bone fragments are displaced, or not well aligned..<br /><h2>Procedure</h2><br />The goal of this procedure is to reposition the talus back in the exact position it was in prior to surgery (anatomically align the fracture), and secure it in this position with screws or a plate. The procedure is usually performed using two incisions: one located on the inside front aspect of the ankle (anteromedial ankle), and the second located on the outside front part of the ankle (anterolateral ankle).  The talar neck fracture is identified, accurately reduced (put back in position), and then fixed in the position it was in prior to the injury. The fracture is first temporarily held in place with wires, and subsequently fixed with screws or a plate to hold the pieces in appropriate alignment as the talus heals. Two incisions are used to ensure that the tube-shaped talar neck has been accurately repositioned on both sides. This is especially important if the talus has fractured into multiple small pieces.If the talar neck fracture is an open injury (bone has broken through the skin) or if it is dislocated (the lower bone of the ankle has dislocated out of the ankle joint), it must be treated urgently with surgery. These are more severe injuries and are more likely to result in complications.<br /><h2>Recovery</h2><br /><em>0-8 (or 12) weeks Post-Surgery</em><br />Immediately after the surgery, the patient is splinted in a cast with the foot flexed upwards (dorsiflexion position). The patient MUST remain non-weight bearing until the fracture heals. Early weight-bearing can displace the fracture, producing a malunion (heals in the wrong position) and/or a non-union (fails to heal) at the fracture site.<em> 6-8 weeks post-surgery</em><br />It is common to take x-rays to assess for healing at the fracture site, and to see if there is evidence of pending avascular necrosis of the talar body (loss of blood supply to the part of the talus that forms the lower part of the ankle joint). Loss of blood supply becomes much more likely if the talus dislocated during the original injury, and can lead to persistent pain and arthritis.<em>After the fracture has healed (typically 8-12 weeks Post-Surgery)</em><br />After x-rays have demonstrated that the fracture has healed, the patient can transition into a walking boot and begin weight bearing as tolerated. Activity at this point in time should be gradually increased. Eventually the patient will be able to transition into a <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/comfort-shoes">comfort shoe</a> </strong></em>and further increase their activity level.Approximately 50-60% of the recovery is within the first 6 months. However, it will be about a 18-24 months before the patient reaches the point of maximal improvement.<br /><h2>Potential General Complications</h2><br /><ul><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#asymmetric-gait">Asymmetric Gait</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#dvt">Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em>Painful Hardware</em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#infection">Infection</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#nerve-injury">Nerve Injury</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#non-union">Non-union</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#pe">Pulmonary Embolism (PE)</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems">Wound Healing Problems</a></strong></em></li><br /></ul><br /><h2>Potential Specific Complications</h2><br /><ul><br />	<li><em>Avascular Necrosis (AVN) of the Talar Body</em>. The blood is supplied to the talus through small blood vessels that run along or near the talar neck. Therefore, a fracture to this area may lead to a loss of blood supply to part of (or all) of the talar body (the part of the talus directly under the ankle). This becomes even more likely if the talus itself dislocates, or moves out of place, because the blood vessels get kinked or torn. When this occurs, it is called avascular necrosis (AVN) of the talar body. If the talar body loses its blood supply, the bone can soften and collapse when a new blood supply is re-established (usually 2-12 months post-injury). AVN with an associated collapse of the talar body invariably leads to <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-arthritis"><em>ankle arthritis</em></a> and/or subtalar arthritis (arthritis below the ankle joint). AVN of the talus is common after talar neck fractures. However, many patients have some AVN of the talus without collapse.</li><br />	<li><em>Malunion</em>.

Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/daniel-cuttica-do-editor/">Daniel Cuttica, DO</a></strong></em>The calf muscle is made up of two muscles: the gastrocnemius and soleus. The gastrocnemius is larger and more superficial. Both of these muscles combine to form the Achilles tendon.When the calf muscle is too tight, there may be difficulty bending the foot backward, This tightness is called a gastrocnemius <em><strong><a href="/equinus-contractures">equinus contracture</a></strong></em>. It is named after the “ankle” position of horses (equine), which point downwards. An equinus contracture can cause altered walking and lead to various foot and ankle problems over time.<br /><h2>Indications</h2><br />A gastrocnemius recession is a procedure that lengthens the gastrocnemius muscle and is often utilized to treat conditions caused by a tight calf muscle. It is indicated for patients who have tightness in their outer calf muscle (the gastrocnemius), and who have failed non-operative management, including several months of Achilles stretching exercises.A gastrocnemius equinus contracture is characterized by the inability to bend the ankle joint past a neutral position (right angle to the lower leg) with the knee straight (Figure 1). Rather than “walk on their toes”, most people naturally and unconsciously “compensate” for an equinus contracture by having more motion through the joint in front of the ankle joint (the transverse tarsal joint – see Figure 2). Many gastrocnemius equinus contractures are subtle and patients are often asymptomatic. However, this midfoot compensation often leads to increased repetitive load to various structures in the foot during standing and walking. Therefore, the presence of an equinus contracture may predispose to the development of certain foot conditions, such as <em><strong><a href="/plantar-fasciitis">plantar fasciitis</a></strong></em>, <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/acquired-adult-flatfoot-deformity-posterior-tibial-tendon-dysfunction">acquired adult flatfoot deformity</a></strong></em>, <em><strong><a href="/metatarsalgia">metatarsalgia</a></strong></em>, or <strong><em>Achilles tendon disorders</em></strong>.  Often a regular calf stretching program (with the knee straight) can lead to succesful non-operative management of symptoms. However, in some instances surgical treatment (often combined with other procedures) is indicated. Gastrocnemius contractures are believed to develop either from:<br /><ul><br />	<li>A hereditary predisposition (our <em><strong><a href="/evolution-of-the-foot">evolutionary ancestors</a></strong></em> had equinus contractures)</li><br />	<li>Aging, which tends to cause muscles to stiffen</li><br />	<li>Medical conditions such as diabetes, which cause muscle to stiffen</li><br />	<li>Immobilization following ankle or foot trauma - particularly if the ankle is splinted in an equinus (downward) position</li><br />	<li>Nerve injury, which can cause an imbalance of muscles in the leg causing the gastrocnemius muscle to tightenrve injury, which can cause an imbalance of muscles in the leg causing the gastrocnemius muscle to tighten</li><br /></ul><br /><h5>Figure 1: Foot does NOT reach a right angle to the lower leg with the knee straight</h5><br />[Content: /wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Equinus-contracture-illustrated-resized1.jpg Goes Here]<br /><h5>Figure 2: Ankle motion PAST neutral with compensation through joint in front of ankle</h5><br />[Content: /wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Equinus-Compensate-Illustrated-resized21.jpg Goes Here]<br /><h2>Procedure</h2><br />Although there are various ways of performing a gastrocnemius recession, they all involve performing an adequate release of the gastrocnemius tendon, in order to lengthen the calf muscle. Typically an incision is made on the back inside part of the lower leg (Figure 3), and the gastrocnemius tendon is exposed. Once the tendon is exposed, it is cut and either left to heal on its own or sutured to the underlying tissue in the newly lengthened position. This effectively lengthens the calf muscle. Patients will now have the same ankle motion with their knee straight that they previously had with their knee bent. After the calf muscle is lengthened, the wound is closed up. The leg is placed in a splint or cast to hold the foot and ankle in a neutral position.<br /><h5>Figure 3: Typical location of calf incision (dotted line)</h5><br />[Content: /wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Gastroc-slide-incision-resized.jpg Goes Here]<br /><h2>Recovery</h2><br />For the first 2-6 weeks, the patient is in a CAM boot, walking boot, or equivalent. It is important that the foot is maintained at a right angle to the lower leg with casting, bracing, or splinting for the first two weeks. Initially, there is a moderate amount of pain in the calf (feels like a smack), but this will settle down in the first couple of weeks. Calf stretching exercises can begin when the patient is comfortable. Also, after the pain has settled in the calf, it’s important to strengthen the calf since the patient will lose strength in the short term. By the 6-8 week mark, the patient can usually walk reasonably normally; however, it my take 8-12 months to regain 90-95% of the original calf strength.A gastrocnemius recession is often done in conjunction with other procedures, thus slower surgical recoveries (ex. bone cuts that need to heal) will take precedence.<br /><h2>General Complications</h2><br /><ul><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems">Wound Healing Problem</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#infection">Infection</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#dvt">Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#pe">Pulmonary Embolism (PE)</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#asymmetric-gait">Asymmetric Gait</a></strong></em></li><br /></ul><br /><h2><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #000000; font-size: 17px; line-height: 25px;">Specific Complications</span></h2><br /><ul><br />	<li><em>Scarring</em>: A prominent scar where the incision was made may develop in some patients.</li><br />	<li><em>Tethering of the skin</em>: The skin incision may become adherent to the tissue overlying the calf muscle (fascia).  This can cause tethering of the skin when the calf muscle moves.

Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/matthew-buchanan-md-editor" target="_blank">Matthew Buchanan, MD</a></strong></em><br /><h2><b>Indications</b></h2><br />Some patients that have <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/posterior-heel-pain">insertional Achilles tendonitis</a></strong></em> with a <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/posterior-heel-pain">retrocalcaneal bursitis</a></strong></em> and a <strong><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/posterior-heel-pain">Haglund’s deformity</a></em></strong>, may benefit from surgical intervention.  This condition can usually be managed without surgery, but there are some patients that continue to be symptomatic and will benefit from having a surgical debridement.  A debridement is a “clean out” procedure designed to remove potential sources of discomfort (bone spurs, degenerated tendon, inflamed soft tissue).<br /><h2><b>Procedure</b></h2><br />Commonly, this procedure is performed through an incision on the back part of the heel.  This incision may be located on either side of the Achilles tendon, or even directly over the tendon.  In some instances, it may be possible to perform this surgery using minimally invasive techniques.  The procedure involves removing the inflamed bursa (fluid-filled sac) behind the Achilles.  It is often necessary to remove the prominent bone (<em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/posterior-heel-pain">Haglund deformity</a></strong></em>), which puts abnormal pressure on the Achilles tendon.  In some instances, there may be calcifications within the Achilles tendon that need to be removed as well.  The goal is to remove inflamed tissue, bone spurs, and degenerated tendon that have developed over the years.<br /><h2><b>Recovery</b></h2><br />Initial recovery involves protecting the surgical repair in a cast or a <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/comfort-shoes">boot</a>, </strong></em>allowing the incision to heal.  Your doctor may ask you to use crutches or a walker.  Depending on the severity of your condition, a range-of-motion program may be started once the incision has healed.  Eventually, a home exercise program or formal physical therapy program will focus on progressive strengthening and stretching.  It often takes one year for full recovery.  This can be a frustrating condition, as many patients have some degree of pain and swelling even three to six months after surgery.  However, things will usually improve so that by the time they are one year after surgery, most patients are doing noticeably better than they were prior to surgery.<br /><h2><b>Potential Complications</b></h2><br />Specific complications that can occur with a surgery on the back of your heel include:<br /><ul><br />	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems"><strong><i>Wound healing problems</i></strong><i>.</i></a>  Surgery on the back of the heel is associated with difficulty in wound healing. This occurs more often in certain patient populations (for example: smokers and diabetics).  The initial period of immobilization ensures that your incision heals properly.</li><br />	<li><i>Rupture of the Achilles</i>.  This is a serious, but fortunately, an unusual complication.  If too much of the Achilles is resected, this can weaken the Achilles and cause it to rupture following surgery.  Although unlikely, if this does occur, it typically requires a return to the operating room to re-attach the Achilles to the heel bone.</li><br />	<li><i>Persistence of Symptoms</i>.  This is a “clean-up” procedure and it is not possible to replace all the scarred tissue with new healthy tissue, so some residual symptoms may persist.</li><br />	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/sural-neuritis/"><i>Sural Nerve Injury</i></a></strong>.  The sural nerve runs next to the Achilles and supplies sensation to the outside of the foot.  This nerve can be stretched or irritated in the course of this surgery.  This can lead to pain, burning, or numbness over the course of the sural nerve.</li><br /></ul><br />General complications include:<br /><ul><br />	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications"><i>Infection</i></a></strong></li><br />	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications"><i>Wound healing problems</i></a></strong></li><br />	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications"><i>Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)</i></a></strong></li><br />	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications"><i>Pulmonary Embolism</i> <em>(PE)</em></a></strong></li><br /></ul><br /><p align="right">Edited on June 6, 2015</p>
<h4>Indications</h4><br />This procedure is performed to address <em><strong><a href="/ankle-instability">ankle instability</a></strong></em>. Patients will typically have a history of recurrent ankle sprains. Their physical exam will demonstrate increased looseness of the outside (lateral) ankle ligaments. This is often confirmed on x-rays with a stress view.<br /><h4>Procedure</h4><br />This procedure is performed through an incision on the outside (lateral) of the ankle.  The incision is opened up down to the ankle joint.  The anterior talofibular ligament is identified. This ligament is typically stretched out.  The dissection is usually extended down to the tip of the fibula (prominent bone on the outside of the ankle) where the calcaneofibular ligament is identified. This ligament is also often scratched out. The anterior talofibular ligament is tightened. This is done by cutting the ligament and repairing it in a tightened position with strong non-absorbable sutures (See Figure 1). This may also be performed on the calcaneofibular ligament if this ligament is also loose. A &quot;modification&quot; to the Broström procedure may be added by identifying the strong extensor retinaculum and incorporating this into the repair. Following the ligament repair the wound is then closed in a layered manner.<br /><h3>Recovery</h3><br />Patients undergoing this type of surgery typically need a 6-week period where the ligaments are allowed to heal. During this time, patients are either non weight-bearing or putting only limited weight through the operated extremity. Patients are sometimes are allowed to place the ankle through a gentle range of motion in order to limit the stiffness. At approximately 6 weeks physical therapy is usually started. This program focuses on:<br /><ol><br />	<li><em>Regaining strength about the ankle</em></li><br />	<li><em>Regaining motion</em></li><br />	<li><em>Improving proprioception</em></li><br />	<li><em>Returning the gait to a more normal manner.</em></li><br /></ol><br />For a number of months after surgery, the repair is often protected with an <em><strong><a href="/ankle-lacers">ankle lacer</a></strong></em> or equivalent. It is common for patients to take 4-6 months to be able to return to high-level activities.<br /><h2>Potential Complications of the Surgery</h2><br />There are some potential risks of surgery that are specific to the lateral ligament reconstruction procedure. This includes<br /><ul><br />	<li><em>Injury to the superficial peroneal nerve:</em> This nerve is often in the wound. The nerve is usually identified and is not normally cut. However, in the repair and healing process, this nerve can become scarred, leading to either decreased sensation over the top of the foot or in some cases, a painful burning sensation in this region. If this type of neuritis occurs, fairly aggressive therapy to desensitize this area is required.</li><br />	<li><em>Stretching out of the repair:</em> This is another potential risk of this surgery.  The repaired ligament is often strong and creates increased stability of the ankle.  However, it is not as strong as the original ligament and further ankle sprains will potentially stretch out this ligament. If revision of a Brostrum repair is required many surgeons will choose to perform a <em><strong><a href="/lateral-ligament-reconstruction-with-tendon-graft">tendon reconstruction of the lateral ligaments</a></strong></em>.</li><br /></ul><br />Patients undergoing the surgery are subject to the potential for the usual risks associated with surgery such as the risk of:<br /><ul><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#infection">Infection</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems">Wound healing problems</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#nerve-injury">Nerve injury</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#dvt">Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#pe">Pulmonary Embolism (PE)</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#continued-pain">Continued Symptoms / Failure to resolve all of the symptoms</a></strong></em>.</li><br /></ul><br />This procedure is designed to effectively treat ankle instability.

<h2>Indications</h2><br />A lateral column lengthening procedure is indicated for patients with acquired adult flatfoot deformity, where the front part of the foot is splayed out to the side. This procedure is often combined with a <em><strong><a href="/calcaneal-osteotomy">medializing calcaneal osteotomy</a></strong></em>, (often referred to as the &quot;All American procedure&quot;), as a technique for adjusting <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/acquired-adult-flatfoot-deformity-posterior-tibial-tendon-dysfunction">acquired adult flatfoot deformity</a></strong></em>. The lateral column lengthening procedure provides a powerful correction in patients with flatfoot foot deformities, however, though it is a procedure with clear advantages, there are also potential disadvantages.<br /><h2>Procedure</h2><br />The lateral column is made up of the calcaneous, the cuboid, and the fourth and fifth metatarsals (Figure 1). Therefore, the lateral column lengthening procedure involves lengthening this region. There are two general ways of doing a lateral column lengthening, both of which involve taking a bone graft and inserting it in the lateral column. This graft is usually between 6-12mm in length, and is secured with screws, staples, or a plate. The bone graft is a trapezoidal bone piece and can be either taken from the top aspect of the pelvis (iliac crest) or, in some instances, from a cadaver.<br /><h5>Figure 1</h5><br />[Content: /wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Lateral-Column-resized.jpg Goes Here]One way of performing this procedure is by cutting the bone (osteotomy) through the front part of the calcaneous. An osteotomy (bone cut) of the calcaneous is performed right before the calcaneal-cuboid joint, which is then spread about 7-10 mm so that the bone graft can be inserted, in order to lengthen the column (Figure 2).<br /><h5>Figure 2: Lateral column lengthening through the calcaneus</h5><br />[Content: /wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Lateral-Column-post-op-resize.jpg Goes Here]Another way of doing this procedure is done through the actual calcaneal-cuboid joint itself. The bone graft is inserted in the joint, which serves as a joint fusion while also lengthening the lateral column.A lateral column lengthening procedure is a very powerful procedure, since it can dramatically change the shape of the foot. The advantages of this procedure include the ability to take a pronounced flatfoot deformity and turn it into a near normal looking foot. However, the disadvantages include the potential of creating a stiffer foot; possibly overcorrecting the foot (which may lead to more symptoms); and a higher rate of specific complications, such as painful hardware, sural nerve irritation, and nonunion.<br /><h2>Recovery</h2><br /><em>0 to 6-10 weeks</em><br />For the first 6-10 weeks, the patient is either non-weight bearing or limited weight bearing through the heel, until the bone graft has healed.<em>6-10 weeks to 12-16 weeks</em><br />For the next 4-6 weeks (assuming the bone graft has healed), the patient can weight bear as tolerated in a cast boot. At the 10-16 week mark, the patient can then transition into a shoe.About 75% of the recovery occurs within the first 5-6 months. However, full recovery can take up to 18 months.<br /><h2>Potential General Complications</h2><br /><ul><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems">Wound Healing Problem</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#infection">Infection</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#dvt">Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#pe">Pulmonary Embolism (PE)</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#asymmetric-gait">Asymmetric Gait</a></strong></em></li><br /></ul><br /><h2>Potential Specific Complications</h2><br /><ul><br />	<li><em>Sural Nerve Injury: </em>Since the sural nerve is located around the region where the surgery is performed, it may get injured, which may cause numbness, irritation, and/or pain.</li><br />	<li><em>Nonunion: </em>The bone graft placed to expand the lateral column may not heal.

Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/paul-juliano-md-editor/">Paul Juliano, MD</a></strong></em><br /><h2>Indication</h2><br />Lateral ankle instability can be treated surgically, either with tightening of the existing ligaments (<em><strong><a href="/lateral-ankle-ligament-repair-reconstruction-brostrom-procedure">Brostrom procedure</a></strong></em>) or a lateral ligament reconstruction using a tendon graft (See Figure #1).  While it is often the preference of the surgeon that determines which of these surgeries is performed, some general guidelines may influence the decision.  A previous failure of an ankle ligament stabilization procedure may be an indication for a reconstruction using a tendon graft. Others feel that tendon graft reconstruction is best even for first time procedures, due to inherent weakness in the scar tissue left after damaging the ligaments. If gross laxity in the ankle exists particularly in a high activity demand patient, a free tendon graft reconstruction is preferable as the existing ligaments are often not amenable to providing enough ankle stability even if they are tightened.<br /><h2>Procedure</h2><br />Tendon reconstruction of the outside ankle ligaments involves stabilizing the stretched out dysfunctional ankle ligaments (anterior talofibular and calcaneofibular ligaments) by weaving a tendon graft through bones on the outside of the ankle where these ligaments normally attach(See Figure 1). This is performed using either: a nearby tendon; a tendon that has been harvested near the patients own knee joint (autograft tendon); or by using a tendon from a cadaver (allograft). The tendon graft is usually placed through the end of the fibula, the talar neck, and often the calcaneus (See Figure 1). There are a variety of ways to perform the reconstruction. In each case, the tendon is pulled tight and secured solidly to the bone so that the ankle joint will be stable when it is subject to an inversion force (See Figure 2).  This procedure attempts to rebuild the lateral ligaments, and places the tendon graft as close to the original anatomic pathway of the lateral ligaments that were torn.<br /><h2>Recovery</h2><br />Recovery from a tendon reconstruction as treatment for ankle instability requires a period of immobilization usually on the order of 6 weeks. Depending on surgeon preference and patient compliance, either a hard cast or a removeable boot cast can be used. This allows the tendon-bone interface to consolidate. After approximately 6 weeks, the rehabilitation phase is started. The rehabilitation phase focuses on:<br /><ol><br />	<li>Improving ankle motion</li><br />	<li>Strengthening the muscles around the ankle</li><br />	<li>Regaining ankle proprioception</li><br />	<li>Improving gait</li><br /></ol><br />Some form of ankle bracing (ex. <em><strong><a href="/ankle-lacers">Ankle lacer</a></strong></em>) is often indicated for 6-12 months following surgery.<br /><h2>Potential Complications of the Surgery</h2><br />There are some potential risks of surgery that are specific to lateral ligament reconstruction procedures. These include:<br /><ul><br />	<li><strong><em>Injury to the superficial peroneal </em></strong><strong><em>or sural</em></strong><strong><em> nerve</em></strong><em>:</em> These nerves often run in the vicinity of the incision. The nerves are usually identified and not normally cut. However, even if the nerves are carefully retracted they may become damaged. Additionally, in the repair and healing process, this nerve can become scarred, leading to either decreased sensation over the top or outside of the foot or, in some cases, a painful burning sensation in this region. The majority of the time, this type of nerve injury recovers. If this type of neuritis occurs, fairly aggressive therapy to desensitize this area is required.</li><br />	<li><strong><em>Stretching out of the tendon reconstruction</em></strong><em>:</em> Failure of the tendon reconstruction, either by stretching out or by the tendon graft pulling out of the bone, can occur. The tendon graft will stretch out when the tendon tissue is not strong enough to withstand the forces applied to it. The strength of the tendon graft is usually very strong when it is initially placed at the time of surgery. However, biologically the tendon graft actually weakens significantly in the months after surgery. This is because the tendon graft is usually without a blood supply when it is surgically positioned. The blood supply slowly gets re-established, and when this happens some of the tendon substance is reabsorbed, causing it to weaken. However, the tendon graft is usually quite strong to begin with so failure of the graft has not been a major problem. Even with a successful ankle ligament reconstruction, if a patient has a subsequent severe enough injury to their ankle, they may tear the tendon graft just like tearing a normal ligament.</li><br />	<li>Another specific potential complication to tendon graft ligament reconstruction is <strong><em>irritation from hardware</em></strong> used to fix the graft to bone. This may require removal with a second surgery.</li><br /></ul><br />Patients undergoing the surgery are subject to the potential for the usual risks associated with surgery such as the risk of:<br /><ul><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#infection">Infection</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems">Wound healing problems</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#nerve-injury">Nerve Injury</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#dvt">Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#pe">Pulmonary Embolism (PE)</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li>Some continued symptoms</li><br /></ul><br />This procedure is designed to effectively treat ankle instability.

<h4><span style="font-size: medium;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 27px;">Indications</span></span></h4><br />An OATs-type procedure is reserved for patients who have been treated with arthroscopic cleaning out (debridement) and microfracture and are still not doing well or patients that have a very large (&gt;20mm²) talar OCL.  This procedure may also be called a mosaicplasty.  An OATs-type procedure involves taking a bone and cartilage plug for another site such as the knee and transplanting it into the talar lesion which is first cored out (See Figure 3).  It is also possible to use a plug of bone and cartilage taken from a cadaver although there is some question about the viability of the cartilage cells in these grafts.  The theoretical advantage of this procedure is that it replaced the damaged cartilage with real cartilage taken from somewhere else.  However, the main disadvantage is that in order to gain access the injured part of the talus it is usually necessary to cut one of the bones of the ankle, essentially creating a controlled ankle fracture.  This explains why the recovery time for this procedure is about three times longer for that of an arthroscopic debridement and microfracture and the complication rate is higher.  Essentially it is a much more involved operation.<br /><h4>Other Procedures</h4><br />If there is other significant pathology this may also need to be addressed at the time of surgery.  This may include:<br /><ul><br />	<li><em>Surgery</em> to address ankle instability such as a <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/lateral-ankle-ligament-repair-reconstruction-brostrom-procedure">Brostom lateral ligament repair</a></strong></em> or a lateral ligament tendon reconstruction.</li><br />	<li><strong><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/calcaneal-osteotomy">Calcaneal osteotomy</a></em></strong> to address significant hindfoot alignment abnormalities (usually hindfoot varus treated with a lateralizing calcaneal osteotomy)</li><br /></ul><br /><h3><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #000000; font-size: 17px; line-height: 25px;">Recovery</span></h3><br />For and OATs-type procedure can be prolonged.  Patients often require 6-8 weeks of non-weight bearing following surgery to allow the osteotomy (bone that was cut) site to heal.  Physical therapy and gradually increasing activity is then undertaken.  Full recovery can take 12-15 months although 80% of the recovery may be achieved within the first 6 months.  Athletes can expect to return to their sport in 9-9 months.  There is an estimated 75-85% success rate for this type of procedures.<br /><h2> <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #000000; font-size: 17px; line-height: 25px;">Complications</span></h2><br />This surgery may lead to a number of standard surgical complications such as:<br /><ul><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#infection">Infection</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems">Wound healing problems</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#dvt">Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#pe">Pulmonary Embolism (PE)</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#nerve-injury">Nerve injuries</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#crps">Complex Regional Pain syndrome (CRPS)</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li>Persistence of symptoms</li><br /></ul><br />Along with above basic complications, there are specific complications associated with arthroscopic debribement and microfracture of  talar osteochondral lesions including:<br /><ul><br />	<li>Failure of graft</li><br />	<li>Arthritis in the ankle joint</li><br />	<li>Transmission of disease or infection if an allograft is used</li><br />	<li>Non-union of the osteotomy site</li><br />	<li>Pain or symptoms at the harvest site</li><br /></ul><br /> 
Edited by <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/anthony-van-bergeyk-md-editor/"><em><strong>Anthony Van Bergeyk, MD</strong></em></a><br /><h2>Indication</h2><br />The main indication for a subtalar fusion is to treat painful arthritis in the subtalar joint ( the large joint above the heel bone and below the ankle). Arthrits in this joint is commonly seen after heel bone fractures or joint dislocations. Another indication for a subtalar arthodesis is for patients who need the change to position of the hindfoot in order to distribute load more evenly. For example, a patient with <em><strong><a href="/acquired-adult-flatfoot-deformity-posterior-tibial-tendon-dysfunction">acquired flatfoot deformity</a></strong></em>, a condition where the heel is offset and load is unevenly distributed, might consider a subtalar fusion.<br /><h2>Procedure</h2><br />On the lateral (outside front) region of the ankle, a cut is made down to the subtalar joint to expose the joint, particularly the larger posterior portion of the joint, or facet. Once exposed, the joint is ready for fusion. First, the cartilage, or what is left of the cartilage, is removed between the heel bone and the talus. Next, the bone is shaved down to a point that can fuse, or heal together like a fractured bone would heal together. The joint is then placed in its desired position and secured with screws (Figure 1). To increase the chance of the joint fusing together, a bone graft is sometimes done, where a piece of bone is taken from another place in the body (e.g. iliac crest of the pelvic bone) or from a cadaver donor. In some select cases the subtalar joint can be exposed and fused with small-incision arthroscopic techniques.<br /><h5>Figure 1:  Subtalar fusion secured with screws</h5><br />^media_display_589c29dede9125bcb76931b5/position:center^<br /><h2>Recovery</h2><br />Patients undergoing this type of surgery will typically need about 6 - 12 weeks for the bone to heal. During this period, the patient is either in a cast or a cast boot, and is non-weight bearing or touch weight-bearing. After the initial non weightbearing period of 6-8 weeks an x-ray is taken and if healing is progressing well or complete then the patient can begin weight-bearing in a cast boot as tolerated for the next 4-6 weeks and begin physical therapy. Physical therapy exercises include motion of other joints in the foot, strengthening, and gait. After the 10-14 week mark, the patient can transition into a shoe. During the first 5-6 months, patients generally get about 75-80% of recovery; however, it will take about 15-18 months for maximal improvement.<br /><h2>Potential General Complications</h2><br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems">Wound Healing Problems</a></strong></em></li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#infection">Infection</a></strong></em></li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#dvt">Deep Vein Thrombosis (Blood Clot)</a></strong></em></li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#pe">Pulmonary Embolism (PE)</a></strong></em></li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#asymmetric-gait">Asymmetric Gait (leading to pain elsewhere)</a></strong></em></li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#continued-pain">Failure to Resolve ALL Symptoms</a></strong></em></li><br /></ul><br /><h2>Potential Specific Complications</h2><br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em>Painful Retain Hardware: </em>Pain may be associated with the screws that are used to secure the joint.

The typical nonunion rate is on the order of 5% for the subtalar joint. If a patient does have a nonunion or a delayed union, they may require a longer period of non weight-bearing, and in some instances will require revision surgery.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>Edited November 14, 2016</p>

<h4>Indications</h4><br />This procedure involves the arthroscopic debridement (cleaning out) and microfracture of the talar OCL.  This is the standard operative treatment and leads to good or excellent results in 75-80% of patients with standard talar OCLs (less than 15mm²). The physician will look inside the ankle using an arthroscope, before reviewing the talar OCL.  The defect is then cleaned up using instruments to ensure that the overlying cartilage does not catch when the ankle joint is moved.  There is often a large crater of bone associated with the OCL and if this is the case then this bone is &quot;microfractured&quot; (See Figure 2).  Microfracturing involves punching a number of small holes in the underlying bone.  This allows blood from the bone to cover the talar OCL and eventually produces an overlying layer of fibrocartilage.  Fibrocartilage is not the same quality as the original hyaline cartilage however, it does provide improved function for the lesion.<br /><h4>Other Procedures</h4><br />If there is other significant pathology this may also need to be addressed at the time of surgery.  This may include:<br /><ul><br />	<li><em>Surgery</em> to address ankle instability such as a <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/lateral-ankle-ligament-repair-reconstruction-brostrom-procedure">Brostom lateral ligament repair</a></strong></em> or a lateral ligament tendon reconstruction.</li><br />	<li><strong><em><a href="/calcaneal-osteotomy">Calcaneal osteotomy</a></em></strong> to address significant hindfoot alignment abnormalities (usually hindfoot varus treated with a lateralizing calcaneal osteotomy)</li><br /></ul><br /><h4><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #000000; font-size: 17px; line-height: 25px;">Recovery</span></h4><br />For arthroscopic debridement and microfracture of talar OCLs the surgery is performed on an outpatient basis.  Following surgery, most patients will not be non-weightbearing or touch weight-bearing for 4-6 weeks following the operation.  Early range of motion is encouraged to facilitate healing.  Full recovery can generally be expected to take about 6-8 months.  Athletes can expect to return to their sport in 4-6 months.  There is an estimated 75-85% success rate for this type of procedures.<br /><h2>Complications</h2><br />This surgery may lead to a number of standard surgical complications such as:<br /><ul><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#infection">Infection</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems">Wound healing problems</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li>Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)</li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#dvt">Pulmonary Embolism (PE)</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li>Nerve injuries</li><br />	<li>Complex Regional Pain syndrome (CRPS)</li><br />	<li>Persistence of symptoms</li><br /></ul><br />Along with above basic complications, there are specific complications associated with arthroscopic debribement and microfracture of  talar osteochondral lesions including:<br /><ul><br />	<li>Supericial Peroneal neuritis</li><br /></ul><br />

<h4>Edited by<a href="http://www.footeducation.com/paul-juliano-md-editor" target="_blank"> Paul Juliano MD </a></h4><br /><h2>Indications</h2><br />This procedure is indicated for patients with a dysfunction of the posterior tibial tendon, either when the tendon is either stretched out beyond its functional length or when the tendon has ruptured. This is common in many <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/acquired-adult-flatfoot-deformity-posterior-tibial-tendon-dysfunction">acquired adult flatfoot deformity</a></strong></em> patients. Essentially, this procedure transfers the FDL so that it will do most or all of the work that the posterior tibial tendon had previously done.<br /><h2>Procedure</h2><br />An incision is made on the inside (medial) of the ankle joint and extended down to the midfoot. After dissecting down, the posterior tibial tendon is identified. The foot is then further dissected down to locate the FDL, which can be identified as a tendon that flexes the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th toes. The FDL is then cut and transferred into the area where the posterior tibial tendon inserts, which can be done in one of two ways: the FDL can be either wrapped around and sutured to the posterior tendon, or it can be directly fixed with a screw or suture to the bone which the posterior tibial tendon inserts (navicular tuberosity). Once the tendon is transferred, the wound is closed up.<br />This procedure is almost invariably done in combination with other procedures, such as a <em><strong><a href="/calcaneal-osteotomy">medializing calcaneal osteotomy</a></strong></em>, a <em><strong><a href="/lateral-column-lengthening">lateral column lengthening</a></strong></em>, or a <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/gastrocnemius-slide-strayer-procedure">gastrocnemius recession</a></strong></em> (<em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/gastrocnemius-slide-strayer-procedure">Strayer Procedure</a></strong></em>), in order to remove the load in the area of the posterior tibial tendon.<br /><h2>Recovery</h2><br /><em>0-6 Weeks Post-Surgery</em><br />Since this procedure is generally done in combination with other procedures, the actual recovery of the tendon transfer is not the slowest healing process. However, patients should generally protect the repair for about 6 weeks to let the tendon transfer heal.<em>+6 Weeks Post-Surgery</em><br />At the 6 week postsurgical mark, patients can begin firing and moving the tendon. Until about 12 months after the surgery, patients will work on re-strengthening the muscle tendon unit. However, keep in mind that the total recovery is set by other procedures that are done.<br /><h2>Potential General Complications</h2><br /><ul><br />	<li><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems"><em><strong>Wound Healing Problem</strong></em></a></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#infection">Infection</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#dvt">Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#pe">Pulmonary Embolism (PE)</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#asymmetric-gait">Asymmetric Gait</a></strong></em></li><br /></ul><br /><h2>Potential Specific Complications</h2><br /><ul><br />	<li><em>Weakness in flexion of the toes</em>: Fortunately, this is not clinically significant.

Edited by <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/anthony-van-bergeyk-md-editor/">Anthony Van Bergeyk, MD</a><br /><h2>Indications</h2><br />Indications for this procedure are generally for cases where additional mechanical strength is needed such as untreated Achilles tendon ruptures  with weakness or painful heel spurs (Haglund’s deformity ) that require Achilles tendon detachment to remove and FHL transfer is used to add mechanical strength to the repair. FHL transfer is also helpful in improving biological healing of surgical treatment for painful chronic tendinitis of the Achilles tendon .<br /><h2>Procedure</h2><br />The technique for this procedure involves harvesting the FHL tendon responsible for flexing the big toe, and transferring it into or around the calcaneous where the Achilles tendon attaches. This can be done in either a two incision technique or one incision technique:The two incision technique involves making an incision on the inside arch of the foot where the FHL tendon is harvested. A second incision is made in line with the Achilles tendon on the inside aspect of the lower leg, where the Achilles tendon is identified, as well as the muscle belly of the FHL. The tendon is then cut closest to the toes and looped through the calcaneous and back onto the Achilles. Alternatively the FHL can be anchored to the bone directly with suture anchor devices.The one incision technique involves making an incision in line with the Achilles tendon on the inside aspect of the lower leg, where the Achilles tendon is identified, as well as the calcaneous and muscle belly of the FHL. The FHL tendon is followed as far as possible into the foot, which is then cut and fixed to the calcaneous.<br /><h2>Recovery</h2><br /><em>0-6 week Post-Surgery</em><br />Patients should generally protect the repair for about 6 weeks to let the tendon transfer heal, while being non-weight bearing or limited weight bearing through the heel in a cast or cast boot. In some cases a wedge or several wedges are placed into the boot or shoe to protect the FHL and/or Achilles from overstretching.<em>6-10 (or 12) weeks Post-Surgery</em><br />Once the repair has adequately healed, the patient can begin moving the foot with minimal resistance and eventually increasing resistance. The patient can begin walking as tolerated in a protective boot, such as a cam walker, and begin physical therapy to work on strength and endurance over the next few months.<em>10 (or 12) weeks + Post-Surgery</em><br />Usually around the 10-12 week mark, the patient can start to transition. About 50-60% of recovery is gained within the first 6 months; however it may not be 15 -18 months for maximal improvement.<br /><h2>Potential General Complications</h2><br /><ul><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#dvt">Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#pe">Pulmonary Embolism (PE)</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#asymmetric-gait">Asymmetric Gait</a></strong></em></li><br /></ul><br /><h2>Potential Complications Specific to FHL Transfer</h2><br /><ul><br />	<li><em>Failure of Graft: </em>Although uncommon the graft may become incompetent or pull out.

<h4></h4><br /><h2>Indications</h2><br />This procedure is performed if the muscles and tendons that normally pass in front of the ankle and lift the foot up are weak or non-functioning (<em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/drop-foot">Drop Foot</a></strong></em>). Often this condition can be treated with bracing, but in patients who desire increased function or who cannot tolerate bracing, this procedure may be of significant benefit. A common cause of a drop foot is the loss of muscle function in the front of the lower leg due to compartment syndrome or peroneal nerve injury. In addition, conditions that cause selective or generalized nerve or muscle weakness, such as <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-cmt-foot-deformities">Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease</a></strong></em>, muscular dystrophy, or stroke, may develop dysfunction of the anterior compartment muscles and benefit from this procedure.<br /><h2>Procedure</h2><br />In this procedure, the surgeon releases the posterior tibial tendon from its insertion into the navicular. The incision is made on the inside (medial) aspect of the foot, and the tendon is released.A second incision, which is about an inch long, is made on the inside of the lower leg, just above the bony lump (medial malleolus) on the inside of the ankle. To identify this spot for yourself, find the bony prominence on the inside of the ankle then go back about an inch and a half, and then up about three inches. This is where the cut tendon of the posterior tibialis is pulled out and then passed behind the tibia, right along the bone.The third incision is made in front of the lower leg, three or four inches above the ankle. The rest of the procedure involves pulling the tendon out through the front of the lower leg, in between the tibia and fibula and through a hole in the strong tissue that holds these two bones together (the interosseous membrane). From there the surgeon has a number of options, depending on the deformity and whether the transferred tendon needs to pull straight up, up and to the inside, or up and to the outside.<br /><h4>Option 1</h4><br />The surgeon can hook the tendon into bone at the top of the midfoot and use a screw to anchor it there. However, one problem with this is that the harvested tendon often isn't long enough to easily reach the top of the foot.<br /><h4>Option 2</h4><br />Another option is to attach the tendon to other tendons, like the tibialis anterior, located at the top inside of the foot, or one of the extensor tendons, which can then be transferred to the top of the foot.<br /><h2>Overview of surgery</h2><br />The posterior tibial muscle and tendon remains attached at the proximal point, runs through the interosseous membrane and is then anchored into the midfoot (ex. The lateral cuneiform).<strong>Technical problems</strong>The tendons have to be rerouted under the band of tissue that keeps the tendons passing across the front of the ankle in place (the extensor retinaculum). This presents an issue, because the procedure requires forcing a tendon through an already packed space.<br /><h4>Re-routing the tendon</h4><br />The tendon can be routed in various ways: it either can be split and then re-routed into two tendons, or it can be routed singularly into the tibialis anterior. The re-routing can be done in a number of ways. The two tendons in question are often woven together. This is done by creating a slit in the tendon you are transferring through which to pull the tendon being transferred, and then suture it into position with non-absorbable sutures. Another slit is then made perpendicular to the other slit, and the process is repeated.<br /><h2>Recovery</h2><br />To allow the tendon transfer to heal, the patient will need six weeks in a cast boot without weight bearing. They will then require another four to six weeks of physical therapy and retraining. Patients will achieve approximately 75% of their recovery in the first six months, as they work to regain the lost muscle strength. It is often longer than a year after surgery before the patient achieves their maximal improvement.<br /><h2>Complications</h2><br />The usual potential risks of surgery are present with this operation, including the risk of:<br /><ul><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#infection">Infection</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems">Wound healing problems</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em>Blood clots</em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#pe">Pulmonary Embolism</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#nerve-injury">Nerve irritation or injury</a></strong></em></li><br /></ul><br />Potential complications that are specific to this procedure include:<br /><ul><br />	<li><em>Failure of the tendon transfer</em>: The transferred tendon could fail by pulling apart after it is loaded.</li><br />	<li><em>Loss of muscle strength</em>: Weakness of the tendon transfer will occur because transferred tendons automatically lose some strength. Muscle strength is graded on a scale of 0 to 5 (0/5 = No function, 5/5 = normal strength). Transferred muscle-tendon units will tend to lose one grade of strength, leading to 4 out of 5 strength when the results are good.</li><br />	<li><em>Out of phase muscles</em>: Another problem is that the muscles-tendon unit that was transferred is now &quot;out of phase&quot;. The muscle isn't supposed to be activated during that phase of gait, but it does in this case. The tibialis anterior usually lowers the foot to the ground and doesn't function much during midstance, but posterior tibialis does.</li><br />	<li><em>Persistent gait asymmetry</em>: This procedure is designed to improve a patient's gait, and hopefully allow patients to go without a brace. However, it will not produce a symmetrical gait and this can lead to symptoms elsewhere (ex. low back)</li><br /></ul><br /><p><span style="font-size: 10px;">Edited April 17, 2015<br /></span></p>

<h2>What is a Pulmonary Embolism (PE)?</h2><br />A <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#pe">pulmonary embolism</a></strong></em> is a very serious and potentially fatal condition that occurs when a blood clot breaks off and goes to the lungs.<br /><h3>What are the risk factors?</h3><br />Risk factors include:<br /><ul><br />	<li>Having a previous PE or blood clot</li><br />	<li>A first degree family member who has had a PE</li><br />	<li>Smoking</li><br />	<li>Birth control pills</li><br />	<li>Obesity</li><br />	<li>Relative Immobilization (e.g. airplane travel)</li><br /></ul>
After you have fully recovered from most major foot surgery there often will not be any specific restrictions that will be placed on your activity level (however, there are certain foot surgeries such as total ankle replacements where running will be prohibited). Nevertheless, it is common to find that you will not be as comfortable doing heavy loading activities (ex. long runs and long hikes) that you may have done in the past. If you do try and return to running after surgery it's important to ease back into it, gradually making sure that you run on soft surfaces when possible and that you always wear good shock absorbing running shoes.It is not often apparent how long it actually takes to recover from major foot surgery. A full recovery takes a long time! Even though you may be able to weight bear after 6-8 weeks it is often 12 months or more before you are fully recovered. There are a few reasons why this is, including:<br /><ul><br />	<li><em>Persistent Swelling:</em> there is increased blood flow to the operated foot for many months after surgery. This is part of the normal healing response. However, it does mean that the foot will swell much more easily than the other side. This can create discomfort and limit the rate at which you increase your activity level.</li><br />	<li><em>Gait Asymmetry due to pain and/or muscle atrophy.</em> Even if your gait looks normal you will likely have significant gait asymmetry when you return to running. This is often due to muscle atrophy in the operated extremity which takes months to normalize. Running with a gait asymmetry often leads to overload of another area (back, opposite hip, etc.) which can become quite symptomatic. A consistent physical therapy program aimed at regaining lost strength and improving the rate at which your muscle strength returns to normal levels can be very helpful.</li><br /></ul>
Patients with painful <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/metatarsalgia">metatarsalgia</a> may gain significant benefit from the use of a metatarsal pad as this pad will tend to offload the area of greatest pressure. To fit a metatarsal pad appropriately perform the following steps:1. Using lipstick or a marking pen outline the main area of discomfort on your sole of your forefoot (See Figure 1)[Content: /wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Figure-1-1024x583.jpg Goes Here]2. Take your orthotic insert out of your shoe and step on it. Then identify the mark left by the lipstick or marker (See Figure 2).^media_display_589c29e0de9125bcb76931c2/position:center^3. Place the metatarsal pad just BEFORE the area outlined by the marker (See Figure 3). The idea is for the metatarsal pad to take much of the load that would otherwise be concentrated over the painful area.^media_display_589c29e4de9125bcb76931c5/position:center^4. Replace the orthotic insert in your shoe and try walking around with the metatarsal pad in place. If you need to adjust the metatarsal pad to another location that will be more comfortable do so.<br /><p>Edited July 16th, 2014</p><h3></h3>
<h2>Foot surgery pre-op suggestions</h2><br />You are about to have foot surgery. It may sometimes be difficult to grasp all of the facts about preparing for foot surgery, so here is an attempt to give you general guidelines to help you on the road to good health and good walking. As all operations differ, it is important that you ask specific questions about anticipated recovery times for your own specific surgery.<strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Preparing-for-Surgery-Checklist-04-27-2013-1.pdf">Click here for a Printable Summary</a></strong><br /><h2>Prior to surgery</h2><br />Before the surgery, you need to prepare to be out of work for anywhere from 3 weeks to 6 months, (depending upon the level of physical exertion needed in your work and the type of surgery you are having). Your physician will discuss a realistic time frame with you. You may be inclined to discount the information, as it is often difficult to anticipate the reasons to be out of work. Most people tend to underestimate the time associated with recovering from foot surgery.<br /><h4>Proactively prepare for the recovery period</h4><br />Try and think about all of the things you are likely to need in the recovery period. Some things to do:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li>Stock up on supplies (food etc.) so you do not need to leave the house often.</li><br /> 	<li>Enlist the help of your family and friends.</li><br /> 	<li>Get some books and movies to occupy your time in the recovery period</li><br /> 	<li>Prepare your house: move objects that will make it difficult to move from one room to another. Consider moving your bed to the ground floor. Prepare your bathroom and shower area (shower stool, grab bars, etc.)</li><br /></ul><br /><h4>Create a &quot;command post&quot;</h4><br />You will be most comfortable if you have a bed &quot;command post&quot; with supplies that you can readily reach. Suggested supplies are:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li>Telephone</li><br /> 	<li>Computer (if you use one) including email addresses, computer movies (best to have someone get them for you or have mail order or downloadable)</li><br /> 	<li>Clock</li><br /> 	<li>TV</li><br /> 	<li>Hospital-type table that slides over the bed or couch may be helpful</li><br /> 	<li>A Foot elevation system of some kind (ex pillows)</li><br /> 	<li>Bed backrest</li><br /> 	<li>Writing materials (ex. pencil, paper, (to keep track of medications))</li><br /> 	<li>Drinking supplies</li><br /> 	<li>Metamucil or Colace as bowel activity is limited by pain medications.</li><br /> 	<li>Hand lotion</li><br /> 	<li>Any handiwork that you might be interested in (don't expect to have the mental ability to take up a new hobby)</li><br /> 	<li>Driving (DMV) - Obtaining a Temporary Handicap Placard: You should consider arranging for a Temporary Handicap placard during your recovery period. In most states, this requires your physician to complete Temporary Disabled Parking Permit. Many surgeons will have these forms in their office. If they do not, you can usually download a form from the state's DMV website. You may be charged a small fee to have this form completed. Once completed, the form can be mailed to the DMV and it takes a few weeks to be processed. Alternatively, you can make an appointment or walk into any DMV office with the form and they will issue the placard. You should consider doing this prior to surgery, as standing in line with crutches while your leg is dangling down shortly after surgery can be problematic</li><br /></ul><br /><h2>Post Surgery</h2><br />After surgery, you will have swelling in the foot, and pain from the incision. The swelling is related to the increased blood flow to the foot in response to the &quot;surgical injury&quot;, as well as the decreased capacity of blood to return to the heart due to fewer lower leg muscle contractions (which have the effect of increasing venous blood return). Swelling is often directly proportional to pain. The greatest swelling occurs in the first 3-4 days after surgery. After that the swelling gradually diminishes. However, it often takes many months (or even a year for major surgery) for all of the swelling to resolve. The pain associated with swelling can vary widely. If it is not managed appropriately, it can be very uncomfortable and frustrating.<br /><h4>Post-operative pain control</h4><br />There are a number of ways that post-operative pain can be managed. You will likely need to use a combination of the following strategies:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em>Post-Operative Nerve blocks:</em> Many anesthesiologist or surgeons will perform local (nerves around the operative site) or peripheral (nerves leading to the operative site) nerve blocks. This is similar to what the dentist does when fixing a cavity. It can leave your foot numb in the short term after surgery. However, it can be very helpful in the hours immediately after surgery and can really minimize the amount of pain medication that is required immediately after surgery. Depending on the type of &quot;nerve block&quot;, the local freezing may last from 3 hours to 15 hours (or longer)</li><br /> 	<li><em>Narcotic pain medication:</em> Narcotic pain medication is often prescribed after surgery. It can be very helpful at managing pain but does have side effects. There are many different types of narcotic pain medication (ex. Vicoden, Percocet, Norco, Tylenol #3). Most are short acting, lasting for 4-6 hours, and will therefore need to be taken regularly to achieve their effect. It is important that you take enough pain medication to stay ahead of severe pain. Some pain medications (ex. Oxycontin) are long acting and therefore only need to be taken 2-3 times per day. Side effects of pain medication can include: nausea and vomiting, confusion (or feeling &quot;weird&quot;), constipation, and the potential for addiction.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Anti-inflammatory pain medication (NSAIDs):</em> Anti-inflammatory medication (ex. Ibuprofen, Advil, Motrin, Aleve, Voltaren, etc.) can be a helpful additional means of managing post-operative foot pain. However, anti-inflammatory medications may have an adverse effect on bone, tendon, and ligament healing so consult your doctor before taking anti-inflammatory medications regularly to help manage your post-operative pain. In addition, NSAIDs can have significant side effects such as stomach irritation, ulcers, bleeding; or kidney problems.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Foot Elevation:</em> Keeping your foot elevated 6-18 inches above your heart can be very helpful at minimizing swelling and therefore decreasing post-operative pain. The best way to elevate your foot in this way is to lie on a bed or sofa with one or two pillows under the foot.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Activity modification</em>: It is critical to avoid activities that will require you to have your foot dangling down for any significant period of time in the early post-operative period. Therefore avoid shopping excursions or other activities where you will be standing for any length of time, in the first few weeks after surgery.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Ice:</em> Ice placed in a plastic bag or a package of frozen vegetables can be very helpful at controlling post-operative pain. Ice should be applied for 10-15 minutes at a time and then removed for 10-15 minutes. Ice should NEVER be used when the foot is numb from a nerve block as this can easily lead to frostbite. A cast or a thick dressing may diminish the effect of the ice as less cooling will get to the operated area. Ice works in part by constricting the small blood vessels around the foot and ankle and thereby decreasing the blood flow to the area. There are commercially available ice pumps that can be helpful, but should again NEVER be used if the foot or ankle is numb.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Work:</em> Be prepared to spend the first one to four weeks lying in bed or on the sofa with your foot elevated. Your primary &quot;work&quot; during this time will be to facilitate foot healing. The first few days you will likely find it too painful to put any weight on any part of your foot, so you will need to be waited upon, or you will need to use crutches and/or a walker, or if your arms are weak a &quot;knee walker&quot;, wheelchair, or scooter. You should not return to work until you believe you can function at an acceptable level. This will depend on the type of surgery you had, as well as the type of job you have. Remember that when you are taking pain medications, your thinking ability may not be 100%. Consider avoiding work conversations and serious emails while you are on regular narcotic pain medications. It may be necessary for your surgeon to write a note outlining how long you need to be off work.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Showering:</em> Showering can be a challenge following surgery on the foot or ankle. It is important to shower in a manner that optimizes safety. Falls in the shower during the post-operative period are surprisingly common and can lead to damage to the surgical area or injury to a different area of the body. When showering, you should sit on a shower stool. A shower stool that is made of plastic or wood will usually tolerate water from a shower. Commercially available shower stools or benches can be purchased and may have some advantages over a regular chair. A human assistant can be very helpful, especially with getting in and out of the shower. It will be helpful to place grab bars in appropriate locations on the shower. These can be obtained at many hardware and bathroom supply stores. You will need a waterproof container to cover your foot and lower leg when showering. This can be achieved by placing a plastic garbage bag over your foot up to the level of the knee. Alternatively you can purchase a commercially available &quot;cast protector&quot; which may be easier and more effective to use. If you do get a cast wet it may be necessary to change the whole cast, as getting the cast lining wet is similar to wearing a wet sock around. It is not at all good for the skin, or for wound healing.</li><br /></ul><br /><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Preparing-for-Surgery-Checklist-04-27-2013-1.pdf">Click here for a Printable Summary</a></strong><br /><p>Edited August 1, 2015</p>
During the first week or two after major foot surgery it is likely that you will not be able to do any significant form of exercise. However, relatively quickly you can get back to some form of exercise although it often may not be the type of exercise that you would prefer. Listed below are a set of exercise programs you can consider as well as precautions you should observe. It is essential to review any planned exercise program with your treating physician.<br /><h4>Stretching and Strengthening</h4><br />Stretching and strengthening your muscles (other than those below the knee on the operated extremity) is a good activity to do and can often be started immediately after surgery. Care is required to ensure that you are not loading the operated extremity (if you are supposed to be non-weight-bearing) and that you keep the operated foot elevated.<br /><h4>Swimming and Water aerobics</h4><br />In theory water activities can be started relatively soon after surgery. Exercises such as swimming with a pull-buoy between your legs (so as to avoid kicking with your legs) and basic water aerobic exercises can often be quite beneficial. However, there are some precautions that you MUST observe including:NEVER swim before all of your incisions are well healed! This usually takes a minimum of 4 weeks. If you get your wounds wet prior to adequate healing you run the risk of having the wounds breakdown which can be a very serious problem.NEVER get a standard cast wet! Some patients have had success swimming with commercially available cast protectors. However, if a leak occurs you will have to get the whole cast changed. Wearing a wet cast is like wearing a wet sock around, it is likely to lead to a serious wound breakdown.<br /><h4>Pilates and Yoga</h4><br />After you are allowed to begin weight-bearing you may be able to return to Pilates or yoga provided you modify some of the exercises so that they do not aggravate foot or ankle that has been operate on.<br /><h4>Exercise Bike</h4><br />Riding an exercise bike with low resistance can be an effective way to maintain aerobic fitness relatively early in the recovery process. This is because cycling on an exercise bike only requires a fraction of your body weight to go through your foot and ankle (compared to 2-4 x body weight with running and walking). However, excessively elevating your hear rate in the recovery period may increase the swelling in the foot that has been operated on. Therefore if you begin an exercise bike program you will have to progress slowly.

<h2>Definition</h2><br />Ligaments are strong connective tissue composed of fibrous tissues. They connect bones to other bones, and are extremely important in stabilizing joints.The ligaments of the foot and ankle can be divided into groups including:<em>1.

Ligaments of the Upper Ankle (Holding the tibia and fibula together)</em><br /><ul><br />	<li>The Anterior Inferior Tibiofibular Ligament</li><br />	<li>The Interosseous Ligament</li><br /></ul><br /><em>3. Ligaments of the Subtalar Joint</em><br /><ul><br />	<li>The Cervical Ligament</li><br /></ul><br /><em>4. Ligaments of the Foot</em><br /><ul><br />	<li>The Lisfranc Ligaments</li><br />	<li>The Intermetatarsal Ligaments</li><br />	<li>The joint capsule of the Great Toe</li><br /></ul><br /><h2>1. Ligaments Stabilizing the Ankle Joint</h2><br /><ul><br />	<li><br /><h4>The Anterior Talo-Fibular Ligament</h4><br />The anterior talo-fibular ligament is often thought of as the &quot;<em><strong><a href="/sprained-ankle">ankle sprain</a></strong></em> ligament&quot;, because it is the one that is most often damaged when the ankle is rolled. It runs down from the fibula and to the outer front portion of the ankle, in order to connect to the neck of the talus. This ligament functions to stabilize the ankle joint and keeps it from rotating inward too much, which is what happens in a common ankle sprain. The ligament itself is very broad, more like a sheet than a rope, and when it is sprained, it tends to tear part of the way rather than into two pieces. Another possibility is that it becomes stretched out in places, which makes the ankle joint looser than normal, potentially leading to symptomatic <em><strong><a href="/ankle-instability">ankle instability</a></strong></em>.</li><br />	<li><br /><h4>The Calcaneo-Fibular Ligament</h4><br />The calcaneo-fibular ligament is almost the &quot;baby brother&quot; of the anterior talo-fibular ligament. It starts at the tip of the fibula and runs along the outside of the ankle, into the calcaneous. It is more rope-like in structure than the anterior talo-fibular ligament, and less susceptible to damage, although it can be damaged during a <em><strong><a href="/sprained-ankle">severe ankle sprain</a></strong></em>.</li><br />	<li><br /><h4>Posterior Talo-Fibular Ligament</h4><br />The posterior talo-fibular ligament runs from the back lower part of the fibula and into the outer back portion of the calcaneous. This ligament functions to stabilize the ankle joint and subtalar joint. Injuries are rare to this ligament, unless there is an ankle dislocation or subluxation.</li><br />	<li><br /><h4>The Deltoid Ligament</h4><br />The deltoid ligament is a fan shaped band of connective tissue on the<em> inside</em> of the ankle. It runs from the medial malleolus (the bottom portion of the tibia) and down into the talus and calcaneous. The deeper branch of the ligament is securely fastened in the talus, while the more superficial, broader aspect runs into the calcaneous. This ligament is extremely strong and stabilizes the inside of the ankle. It can be torn, but it takes tremendous force. Tears of this ligament are most common when the ankle undergoes an <em><strong><a href="/unstable-ankle-fracture">unstable ankle fracture</a></strong></em>. Like the anterior talo-fibular ligament, the deltoid is rarely torn completely and tears tend to resemble a torn or stretched sheet.</li><br /></ul><br /><h2>2. Ligaments of the Upper Ankle (Holding the tibia and fibula together)</h2><br /><ul><br />	<li><strong>Anterior Inferior Tibial Fibular Ligament   </strong></li><br /></ul><br />The anterior inferior tibial fibular ligament is commonly known as the &quot;high ankle sprain ligament&quot;. It is positioned on the lower front of the ankle and helps keep the tibia and fibula together. Injuries to this ligament occur when the foot is stuck on the ground and rotated inwardly. This injury can be very painful and can scar, which can cause irritation to the outside of the ankle joint, a condition known as anteral-lateral ankle impingement.<br /><ul><br />	<li><strong>The Interosseous Membrane</strong></li><br /></ul><br /><p>The interosseous membrane is composed of strong fibrous tissue and runs along the tibia and fibula, and keeps the two bones moving as one unit. It can be torn from a type of <em><strong><a href="/unstable-ankle-fracture">unstable ankle fracture</a></strong></em>, known as a Weber Type C ankle fracture, in which the tibia and fibula have to be torn apart.</p><h2>3. Ligaments of the Subtalar Joint</h2><br /><ul><br />	<li><br /><h4>The Cervical Ligament</h4><br />Also known as the subtalar ligament, this ligament connects the calcaneous to the talus in front of the subtalar joint. It keeps the calcaneous in place relative to the subtalar joint, so the two bones do not move completely independently of one another.</li><br /></ul><br /><h2>4. The Ligaments of the Foot</h2><br /><ul><br />	<li><br /><h4>Lisfranc Ligaments</h4><br />The Lisfranc ligaments stabilize the small bones of the mid-foot, as well as the transverse tarsal joint. They are stronger across the plantar (sole) of the foot than on the dorsal (top) aspect, though they are very strong in either case. These ligaments were described by the Napoleonic era surgeon Jacques Lisfranc, who noticed that when people fell from their horses but got their foot stuck in the stirrup, they dislocated portions of the mid-foot. These dislocations (<em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/lisfranc-injury-fracture-midfoot-sprain">Lisfranc Injuries</a></strong></em>) are very problematic, and took a long time to heal.</li><br />	<li><br /><h4>The Inter-Metatarsal Ligaments</h4><br />These ligaments run between the metatarsal bones at the base of the toes. They connect the neck region of each metatarsal to the one next to it, and bind them together. This keeps the metatarsals moving in sync. While it is possible to tear these ligaments, it is also possible for them to irritate the digital nerve as it crosses the ligaments, potentially leading to a <em><strong><a href="/mortons-neuroma">Morton's neuroma</a></strong></em>.</li><br />	<li><br /><h4>The Joint Capsule of the Big Toe</h4><br />The connective tissue of this ligament takes the form of a capsule. It goes from the inner portion of the first metatarsal head and stretches to the distal phalanx on the inside. This allows this ligament to stabilize the great toe on the inside. In the situation where a person develops a <em><strong><a href=" /bunions-hallux-valgus">bunion</a></strong></em>, this band gets stretched out, and the toe changes position because of this.</li><br /></ul><br /> <br /><p>Edited October 17, 2015</p>
After a detailed review of the peer-reviewed literature, understanding how foot orthotics are purported to work, and the cost of producing custom orthotics, the following conclusions can be drawn:<br /><ol><br />	<li>There is evidence to support the use of orthotics (either OTC or custom) compared to no orthotics, as part of the treatment plan for certain existing foot and ankle conditions (ex. Plantar fasciitis, acquired adult flatfoot deformity with posterior tibial dysfunction, etc.)</li><br />	<li>There is very little evidence to support the use of orthotics (either OTC or custom) compared to no orthotics for prophylaxis against developing overuse injuries (ex. Tendonitis, stress fractures, etc.)</li><br />	<li>Rigid orthotics (such as the UC Berkeley Laboratory) can partially control the foot position during gait, however, to do this they must exert a force against the plantar aspect of the foot, equivalent to 3-4x body weight. This force creates significant patient discomfort and explains why rigid orthotics have fallen out of favor.</li><br />	<li>The common foot orthotics used today (either OTC or Custom) are either semi rigid or accommodative, and have NOT been shown to adequately control hindfoot motion. They essentially function like a bed for your foot to allow more even dispersion of force over the surface of the foot.</li><br />	<li>There is NO significant evidence in the peer reviewed literature to support the use of Custom Orthotics over appropriate Over the Counter (OTC or prefabricated) orthotics, for the treatment of common foot and ankle problems (ex. Overuse injuries).  There is good evidence in the literature (see references) and based on how orthotics are purported to work (see conclusions #3 and #4) to conclude that appropriately selected OTC orthotics and custom orthotics will provide equivalent results, except in cases where there is a markedly abnormal foot deformity (metatarsal fractures that have healed with marked displacement or a marked Charcot midfoot deformity).</li><br />	<li>To be optimally effective, OTC orthotics need to be appropriately selected. For example, patients with flatfoot related problems should have a medial arch support, high arched foot patients should have a recessed area under their first metatarsal head (not an excessively high arch), and patients with 2nd and 3rd metarsalgia should use an orthotic with a metatarsal pad.</li><br />	<li>Manufacturing of custom orthotics is close to a billion dollar a year industry in the United States, and quite often the individual prescribing the orthotoic is also profiting from the orthotics.</li><br />	<li>If the idea of spending $300-$350 for a custom orthotic rather than $30-60 for an OTC orthtotic does not bother you, then by all means go for the custom orthotic.</li><br />	<li>No orthotic (Custom or OTC) will be able to adequately treat all foot problems and depending on their particular problem many patients will still have some symptoms after obtaining appropriate orthotics.</li><br /></ol><br /><h2>References</h2><br />(These references where taken from <em>Foot and Ankle International</em> (FAI) the leading orthopaedic peer-reviewed journal devoted to Foot and Ankle Problems.)&quot;The routine prophylactic use of orthotics in flat-footed athletes to prevent future injury may therefore not be justified based on the data available.&quot;<br /><div style="padding: 0 0 10px 50px;"><br /><h5><em>— Michelson FAI July 2002</em></h5><br /></div><br />&quot;Since prescribed orthoses are expensive and replaced regularly as the child grows, this therapy may represent a substantial financial burden to families with young children.

Edited  by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/kenneth-j-hunt-md-editor" target="_blank">Ken Hunt, MD</a></strong></em><br /><h2>Summary</h2><br />The metatarsals are five long bones that lead up to the base of each toe. The fifth metatarsal is the prominent bone on the outside of the foot, and is unique when compared to the other four metatarsals for a number of reasons: it is the only metatarsal with extrinsic tendon attachments.  The peroneus brevis and peroneus tertius tendons both attach to the base of the 5th metatarsal, and function to rotate the foot outward and help to prevent <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/sprained-ankle/">ankle sprains</a>.  Additionally, the base of the 5th metatarsal has very little skin and soft tissue coverage on the outside and bottom of the foot. This puts the bone at increased risk of fracture and delayed healing of fractures.Fifth metatarsal fractures account for almost one quarter of all metatarsal injuries, and most occur at the base of the bone. The base of the fifth metatarsal is located on the outside (lateral) aspect of the foot where you can feel a prominent bone, about half way along the length of the foot. There are two types of 5th Metatarsal base fractures:<br /><ol><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/dancers-fracture-5th-metatarsal-avulsion-fracture">Avulsion Fractures (Dancer's Fractures)</a></strong></em></li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/jones-fracture-5th-metatarsal-stress-fracture">Stress Fractures (Jones' Fractures) </a></strong></em></li><br /></ol><br /><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/dancers-fracture-5th-metatarsal-avulsion-fracture"><i>Dancer's fractures</i></a></strong>, also called fifth metatarsal avulsion fractures, are the most common, representing 90-95% of all 5th metatarsal base fractures (Figure 1A). They occur when the ankle is rolled inward.  The proposed mechanism of injury is that one of the peroneal tendons attaching to the base of the 5th metatarsal pulls off this part of the bone. However, evidence suggests that a ligament attaching to the nearby cuboid bone may be primarily responsible for the avulsion.  Regardless of the actual cause, most of these fractures are stable and can be treated without surgery. However, they can take a number of months to heal completely.<br /><h5>Figure 1A: Dancer's Fracture</h5><br />[Content: /wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Figure-1-Dancers-fracture_thumb.jpg Goes Here]<strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/jones-fracture-5th-metatarsal-stress-fracture"><i>Jones' fractures</i></a></strong> are fractures of the base of the 5th metatarsal, about a centimeter from the location of avulsion fractures (Figure 1B). Although they can occur with a severe inward sprain or an awkward step, they are usually caused be repeated stress to this location of the bone (i.e., “<a href="http://www.footeducation.com/stress-fractures">stress fracture”</a>). Like other stress fractures, Jones' fractures occur in a manner similar to the way that you would break a paper clip (by wiggling it back and forth over and over again, until it breaks with one force). They often occur after repetitive activities (e.g. sports). They tend to occur in people that have a <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/characteristics-of-high-arched-foot-subtle-cavus">high arched foot shape</a> or a lower extremity alignment that tends to load the outside of the foot (e.g., being &quot;bow legged&quot;).Often Jones' fractures can be treated without surgery. However, they have a tendency to recur because even after they have healed, the underlying reason why they occurred (weight-bearing tendencies of the foot) is still present. Therefore surgical treatment of a Jones' fracture may be recommended, particularly in young, active people, in order to prevent recurrence of the fracture or non-healing of the fracture.<br /><h5>Figure 1B: Jones' Fracture</h5><br />[Content: /wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Figure-1-Jones-Fracture-x-ray-Resize.jpg Goes Here]<br /><p align="left">Edited on January 4, 2017</p><div></div>

<h4>Summary</h4><br />There are three common conditions that are caused by Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) in the hindfoot. These problems include:<br /><ol><br />	<li>Talonavicular Arthritis</li><br />	<li>Rheumatoid Hindfoot Deformity</li><br />	<li>Rheumatoid Ankle Arthritis</li><br /></ol><br /><ul><br />	<li><em>Rheumatoid Hindfoot Deformity: </em>This condition is common in people that have RA in the hindfoot.This condition includesa significant painful flatfoot deformity with arthritis of the hindfoot joints.</li><br /></ul><br /><h4>Clinical Presentation</h4><br />Swelling of the hindfoot, with an associated flatfootdeformity is often observed in patients with this condition. The heel is also often in valgus. Patients usually walk with a limp andare unable to perform a single leg heel rise.Pain is aggravated by standing and walking, especially onuneven terrain.<br /><h4>Imaging Studies</h4><br />Weight bearing plain x-rays are helpful in diagnosing this condition. The subtalar andtalonavicular joints can be evaluated for arthritic involvement.<br /><h2>Non-Operative Treatment</h2><br />Comfort shoes and ankle bracing with an <em><strong><a href="/ankle-lacers">ankle lacer</a></strong></em> can behelpful, in addition to activity modification. The use of a cane and anti-inflammatory medications can alsobe helpful. A gentle, home therapy program can aid in keeping the joints movingif there is no significant arthritis.<br /><h2>Operative Treatment</h2><br />Triple arthrodesis, or fusion of the subtalar,talonavicular, and calcanealcuboid joints can be performed on patients who havefailed non-operative treatment. This procedure recreates the arch of the foot, reducing the flatfoot deformity. In rare instances, thesubtalar and talonavicular joints are normal and only a flatfoot reconstructionmust be performed.<br /><h4>Recovery</h4><br />6-8 weeks in a cast is required to allow the bones to heal.After this initial timeperiod, the patient can gradually begin walking in a boot, such as a cam walker. At this point, physicaltherapy should begin to work on strengthening and gait retraining. Patients are often dramatically betterat the 10-12 week mark. It generally takes over a year to reach a point of maximal recovery.<br /><h4>Complications</h4><br />Non-union of at least one joint occurs in about 5% of cases. Often, it is thetalonavicular joint that does not heal fully. Additionally, infection, wound healing problems,neurological injury, DVT, pulmonary embolism, and persistent symptoms fromanother source are other possible complications. It is important to understand that symptoms originating fromthe ankle or forefoot will not be addressed with this procedure.
Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/christopher-w-digiovanni-md-editor">Chris DiGiovanni, MD</a></strong></em><br /><h2>Summary</h2><br />One of the most common ways that <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/rheumatoid-arthritis">Rheumatoid Arthritis </a></strong></em>(RA) is initially diagnosed is when it presents as a problem in the foot. Although rheumatoid arthritis can affect any part of the foot or ankle, including the hindoot and midfoot, the forefoot represents one of the most common sites affected by this disease process.  Forefoot deformity and disease from rheumatoid arthritis can present in many different ways and with varying severity and chronicity.  Despite this large spectrum of pathology, however, there is often a classic forefoot deformity present that affects all five digits (rays), and will be described below.  There are many new pharmaceutical therapies evolving as treatment possibilities to control RA today.  Some of these hold great promise in improving quality of life—but even when the disease is brought under control, patients may still face ongoing difficulties associated with any residual arthritis and resultant deformity.<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />Numerous deformities are associated with RA, which is a disease of joints and can therefore affect any articulation of the forefoot.  These joints include the metatarsophalangeal (MP) articulations (joints at the base of the toes) of rays 1-5 (big toe-little toe), as well as the interphalangeal (IP) joints within the toes themselves. The deformities occur as a result of a build-up of cellular and inflammatory mediators that are a byproduct of the RA disease process inside and around each of these joints.  While RA cannot always be predicted to affect any particular joint or joints in any one patient’s case, it usually affects multiple joints at one time. When it involves the forefoot, RA typically causes gradual destruction, arthritis, and capsular attenuation of the MP joints of all five toes.  This arthritic and erosive process can deteriorate both the bone and soft tissues surrounding these joints, and deformity can therefore occur in any plane due to the resultant instability and irregularity that occurs.  The classic presentation includes slowly progressive swelling in the forefoot, discomfort across all of these joints, and deformity.  Deformities often include:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li>A <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/bunions-hallux-valgus">bunion (hallux valgus)</a></strong></em> deformity with arthritis of the first MTP joint,</li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/claw-toes">Clawing (contracture)</a></strong></em> of all the lesser toes, and</li><br /> 	<li>Subluxation or dislocation of the lesser MTP joints.  This can lead to the involved toes being retracted and pulled up off the ground, causing them to no longer contact the sole of the shoe and instead rub along the top of the shoe.</li><br /></ul><br />Patients with <strong><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/claw-toes/">clawed toes</a></em></strong> that result in dislocation often complain of feeling like they are “walking on a pebble” because of the retracted padding beneath these toes.  This retracted padding causes the bony metatarsal heads to be prominent on the sole of the foot.  The toes frequently not only retract upward, but also malrotate and thereby cross over one another.  This rubbing can be very irritating and can also lead to skin ulceration or infection if not carefully monitored and treated.  Such deformities and their associated pain are usually obvious upon physical examination.  Associated nail deformities are also common, and the disease process is frequently bilateral.<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />Although a diagnosis of RA can often be made clinically, x-rays are helpful to confirm the extent of the pathology.  The radiographic findings are relatively unique when the disease process has progressed.  Classic RA causes the bones to be less dense (osteopenia).  In addition, there is a symmetric loss of bone where the joint capsule attaches (periarticular erosions) in the MP joints in the forefoot.  Loss of joint space on x-ray can be mild in nature, but there can be remarkable destruction of the entire metatarsal heads in more severe cases.  Both sides of the MP joints are usually affected.  The disease can also deform the other joints of the toes (IP joints).<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br /><h3>Non-Operative Treatment</h3><br />The goal of non-operative management is to render the deformed and/or diseased portion of the forefoot as comfortable and “shoe-able” as possible, as well as to minimize any chance of ulceration or infection. Non-operative treatments of RA of the forefoot may include:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/comfort-shoes"><i>Comfort shoes</i></a></strong>  Shoes characterized by a wide toe box can be extremely helpful in managing the pain (frictional irritation and rubbing) associated with RA.</li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/pre-fabricated-over-the-counter-orthotics-insert"><i>Orthotic inserts</i></a></strong> that are bought over the counter or custom-made can be similarly used to help offload any area of bony prominence.</li><br /> 	<li><i>Corn pads, silicone caps, or basic padding</i>.  These can also be used to protect bony prominences. There are also devices available to help improve claw toe position.</li><br /> 	<li>Activity modification can also be helpful in managing pain due to RA in the forefoot.</li><br /> 	<li><i>Physical Therapy</i>.  In some instances, physical therapy or a stretching program may be recommended in order to help maintain joint mobility.</li><br /> 	<li><i>Optimizing medical management of the RA</i>.  Obviously optimizing disease control with various drug trials through one’s primary care physician can go a long way towards maintaining a level of comfort and disease control, that also avoids any need for surgical intervention for these joints.  It is critical that the RA itself be managed systemically with the help of one’s rheumatologist and/or primary care doctor, to minimize the possibility of disease progression that could lead to further damage and deformation.</li><br /></ul><br /><h3>Operative Treatment</h3><br />Operative treatment for the rheumatoid forefoot must be directed towards the patient’s chief complaint, as well as any at-risk area in the forefoot.  Operative treatment options include:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><strong><i><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/surgical-procedures/clawtoe-correction/">Clawtoe corrections</a> </i></strong>For mild to moderate deformity, procedures to straighten claw toes and restore toe competence with the ground can be very rewarding. If a joint is not yet dislocated and has reasonably well-preserved cartilage, it is preferable to preserve the MTP joints by reducing the subluxed joint and correcting the claw toes.</li><br /></ul><br />For moderate to severe forefoot deformities, however, the surgical options vary and become somewhat more complicated. Typically in these cases fusion surgery, when possible, is desired and may include:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><strong><i><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/great-toe-fusion-1st-mtp-joint-fusion">Great toe fusion</a> </i></strong>For a bunion deformity of the great (1st) toe, it is common for the great toe MP joint to be straightened and fused—as opposed to simply being realigned as it might be in a much more mild MP condition. This procedure greatly reduces the pain in the great toe, and is quite durable and well tolerated.  Various forms of 1st MP joint replacement exist, but these implants have not withstood the test of time, and have not proven as durable or reliable as fusion of the great toe in more severely involved cases.</li><br /> 	<li><i>Lesser Toe procedures</i>.  The various lesser toe deformities caused by RA in the forefoot can also be addressed in different ways. When the disease process is quite early and there is little deformity or arthritic change, consideration can be given to simply re-aligning the MP and IP joints via open reductions of the MP joints; possible shortening osteotomies of the metatarsals; and hammertoe repairs.  This operation can be quite functional for the patient as long as the joints themselves start and remain in good condition.</li><br /> 	<li><i>Clayton-Hoffman Procedure</i>.  In severe RA, the MP joint at the base of the toes may be too arthritic or displaced to be preserved. In this situation, it may be necessary to perform a standard Clayton-Hoffmann procedure, which involves a resection of all four lesser (rays 2-5) metatarsal heads, along with an associated correction of the claw toes themselves.  This can be very effective for pain relief of a moderate to severely deformed/arthritic forefoot. While this lessens the pain, however, it does not address the dysfunction of the foot and it should therefore be considered an effective but nonetheless salvage procedure. With this operation, the toes will no longer be able to articulate, which will limit the patient’s activity. The toes are much stiffer and straighter, and patients will state they “just float in space there”.  They can also describe a much decreased push-off strength in this foot, even though the pain is remarkably improved as compared to pre-operatively.  Despite these limitations, however, almost all of these patients, if bad enough to justify the procedure in the first place, will state they would have the procedure again if such a choice had to be re-made.</li><br /></ul><br />Treatment of each foot and each toe in all cases must be individualized for the patient, keeping in mind his or her chief complaint, relative co-morbidities, and the potential/presumed natural progression of the disease.  Because of the symmetric and diffuse nature of RA, forefoot surgery typically involves addressing all five rays at once.  This is the rule rather than the exception for most patients.<br /><h2>Recovery</h2><br />Although specific recovery directions will accompany each procedure, in most cases weight-bearing will be avoided for the first few weeks after surgery, enabling adequate soft tissue healing and then restricted but progressed thereafter once skin sutures can be removed.  Following the initial six weeks, a gradual increase of activity is permitted in conjunction with a progressive physical therapy program.  Usually once the initial splint/immobilization is removed a few weeks post-operatively, the patient is placed into another form of immobilization that is comprised of a special shoe, <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/cam-walker-walking-boot">walker boot</a></strong></em>, or splint variety to protect the repair while it heals. As swelling and discomfort subside, the function usually improves. Although healing after these cases usually takes between 6-12 weeks, depending on the nature of the surgery, it can often take one full year for a complete (maximal) recovery.  In the absence of any complications, transition to regular shoewear typically occurs between 8-16 weeks post-operatively.  Fortunately, despite the complexity of this surgery and the length of its recovery, the overwhelming majority of patients are very pleased with their outcomes.  Pain relief and alignment are usually much improved, “shoe-ability” is often much improved, and patients therefore tolerate the other unavoidable limitations of such surgery on the foot.<br /><h2>Complications</h2><br />Common surgical complications after rheumatoid forefoot surgery are similar to other areas of orthopaedic surgery, and include:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems"><strong><i>Wound healing problems</i></strong> </a> Skin and soft tissue incisional healing issues are more common in RA patients</li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#infection"><i>Infection</i></a></strong></li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#dvt"><i>Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)</i></a></strong></li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#pe"><i>Pulmonary Embolism</i></a></strong></li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#non-union"><i>Nonunion</i></a></strong></li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#non-union"><i>Malunion</i></a></strong></li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#vascular-injury"><i>Vascular injury</i> </a></strong>Vascular embarrassment of one or more toes is uncommon, but can happen</li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#nerve-injury"><i>Nerve injuries</i></a></strong> may lead to numbness of one or more of the toes.</li><br /> 	<li><i>Recurrent deformities</i></li><br /></ul><br /><p>It is important to remember that certain RA medications must be stopped 2-6 weeks prior to any surgical procedure, and this should be discussed with the patient’s caregivers.  Some of these medications are known to increase the chances of infection and wound healing problems. Again, fortunately in experienced hands and with compliant patients who are otherwise reasonably healthy, such complications are fairly rare.</p><br /><p>Edited on December 21, 2016</p>
Edited by <strong><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/hussein-pazkad-md/">Hossein Pakzad, MD</a></em></strong><br /><h2>Summary</h2><br />A Pilon fracture is a major injury involving the ankle joint. The fracture involves the larger bone of the lower leg (tibia), and extends into the weight bearing surface of the ankle joint. It usually occurs following a major load to the foot, such as a fall from a height or motor vehicle accident (MVA).  The bone of the lower part of the ankle joint (talus) is driven into the top of the ankle joint, causing the fracture.  It is a painful injury associated with a fair amount of swelling. Treatment is often surgical if the fracture is displaced. Surgery attempts to restore the shattered bone back to its original position. It often takes many months for the fracture to heal.  Some <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-arthritis">ankle arthritis</a></strong></em> and joint stiffness is common even with optimally treated Pilon fractures.<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />Patients with Pilon fracture usually have suffered an excessive load or force to the ankle joint, such as a fall from a height or a motor vehicle accident. It is common for patients to have other injuries. They normally cannot walk on the affected limb due to pain and distorted anatomy. A Pilon fracture is associated with marked pain and swelling and is often extremely uncomfortable.<br /><h2>Physical Examination</h2><br />Physical examination will show significant swelling involving the ankle joint and the lower leg. There may be associated deformity if the ankle fracture is significantly out of the normal position.  It is important to check the nerve and the blood supply to the foot, as this can be compromised.  It is also important to check the other muscles, bones, and joints to see whether there are any other associated injuries.  There is limited muscle and soft tissue coverage over the ankle joint, and it is not uncommon for this injury to be open whereby a part of the fracture pokes through the skin.  If this occurs, it is necessary to get this treated surgically in an expedited manner in order to minimize the risk of infection.<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />A plain x-ray will usually allow the injury to be diagnosed.  It will identify the fractures that involve the lower leg bone and extend into the ankle.A CT scan is usually required to elaborate the fracture pattern and to help the surgeon understand the nature of the fracture, which varies considerably from patient to patient.  The defining feature of a Pilon fracture is a fracture that extends into the weight-bearing portion of the ankle joint.<br /><h5>Figure 1</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Figure-1-Pilon-Fracture-X-Ray.png">^media_display_589c29f1de9125bcb7693219/position:center^</a><br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br /><h3>Non-Operative Treatment</h3><br />Occasionally, either because the fracture is nondisplaced or because surgery is contraindicated, the patient can be treated without surgery.  Non-operative treatment requires a prolonged period (10 to 12 weeks) of non weight-bearing to allow the fracture to heal.  Patients are usually placed in a splint and cast during that time.<br /><h3>Operative Treatment</h3><br />Most Pilon fractures in otherwise healthy individuals are treated with surgical stabilization.  This is often performed once the swelling has settled.  This means that the surgery will be performed a number of days or even weeks after the original injury, when the soft tissue is ready.  During this time, the foot will be elevated and sometimes it will be placed in an external frame (external fixator) to help stabilize the soft tissues that are often significantly damaged after this type of injury.The surgery itself can be quite complex.  It essentially involves repositioning the fractured bone fragments back into the right position.  It is particularly important that the bone that makes up the top part of the ankle joint (the tibial plafond) be restored to as close to a normal (anatomic) position as possible.  This procedure is performed through one or more incisions. Once the fractures are provisionally fixed with wires, they are definitively stabilized with a plate and screws - or a series of plates and screws. Sometimes the fibula, or the smaller bone located on the side of the ankle joint, is also fractured and needed to be fixed.Following the surgery, the patient is kept non-weight bearing until the bone heals, which often takes 10 to 12 weeks or more.<br /><h5>Figure 2</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Figure-2-Pilon-Fracture-Following-Surgery.png">^media_display_589c29f3de9125bcb769321c/position:center^</a><br /><h2>Potential Complications</h2><br />This is a potentially very serious high-energy injury with a reasonably high complication rate.  The main surgical complications are:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#infection"><i>Infection</i></a></strong></li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems"><i>Wound healing issues</i></a></strong></li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/painful-hardware"><i>Painful prominent hardware</i></a>. </strong>This may also be a complication over time.

<h2>Indications</h2><br />Triple arthrodesis is indicated for patients who have a deformity of the hindfoot, such as <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/acquired-adult-flatfoot-deformity-posterior-tibial-tendon-dysfunction">acquired adult flatfoot deformity</a></strong></em>, where there is arthritis or stiffness in the involved joints. This type of procedure sometimes offers a more reliable result than other hindfoot corrective procedures.Because of the importance of preserving all the joints in the foot, this procedure is done a lot less often than it used to be. However, if there is enough arthritis or dysfunction in the involved joints where preservation is improbable, then a triple arthrodesis may be effective.<br /><h2>Procedure</h2><br />This surgical procedure involves the fusion of three joints: the talonavicular joint, the subtalar joint, and the calcaneal-cuboid joint (See Figure #1). Two incisions are made on both sides of the foot; one is made on the inside (medial) to expose the talonavicular joint, and the other is made on the outside to expose the subtalar joint, the calcaneal-cuboid joint, and the outside (lateral) aspect of the talonavicular joint. Once exposed, all of the remaining cartilage from the joints is removed and prepared for fusion. Typically, the joint is then packed with bone graft from other bones, such as the proximal tibia or the iliac crest (located at the top of the pelvic bone). Once all the joints have been prepared and the bone graft has been placed, the hindfoot position is corrected to a neutral position. Once repositioned, the foot is first provisionally fixed with wires, and then definitively fixed with screws or plates in each joint. Once everything is in place, the incisions are closed up with sutures.<br /><h5>Figure #1 (Triple Arthrodesis)</h5><br />[Content: /wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Triple-Arthrodesis-Resized.bmp Goes Here]<br /><h2>Recovery</h2><br /><em>0-6 (or 8) weeks Post-Surgery</em><br />Patients will not bear any weight on the operated leg for the first 6-8 weeks after surgery, in order for the joints to heal. However, the talonavicular joint is challenging to become fully healed, so the healing process could be longer. During this time, patients are usually in a cast or splint to immobilize the foot in its corrected position.<em>6 (or 8) weeks - 12 (or 14) weeks Post-Surgery<br /></em>At 6 or 8 weeks postoperatively, if x-rays demonstrates satisfactory healing, patients are then allowed to begin weight-bearing as tolerated in a protective cast boot. This boot can be removed to allow showering and physical therapy. At this point physical therapy is started. Patients will work on strengthening their muscles, improving their gait, and working on their range of motion.<em>12 (or 14) week + <em>Post-Surgery<br /></em></em>At that point, patients can begin walking in a stiff soled shoe, often with a supportive ankle device.Patients will obtain approximately 60-70% of their recovery in 5-6 months. However, it is often 15 or even 18 months before a patient reaches their point of maximal improvement.<br /><h2>Potential Complications</h2><br /><strong>General Complications</strong><br /><ul><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems">Wound Healing Problem</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#infection">Infection</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#dvt">Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#pe">Pulmonary Embolism (PE)</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#asymmetric-gait">Asymmetric Gait </a></strong></em></li><br /></ul><br /><strong>Specific Complications</strong><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#non-union"><em>Nonunion</em></a></strong>. A nonunion occurs when the fusion site fails to adequately knit together. The nonunion rate is dependent upon: the surgical technique; the patient's underlying condition; whether the patient smokes cigarettes; and the patient's compliance with the postoperative non weight-bearing protocol. The typical nonunion rate is on the order of 5% for the subtalar and the calcaneal-cuboid joint, but the nonunion rate for the talonavicular joint is around 5-8%. If a patient does have a nonunion or a delayed union, they may require a longer period of non weight-bearing and, in some instances, will require revision surgery.<strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#nerve-injury"><em>Nerve Injury</em></a></strong>. Injury to the nerve on the outside aspect of the foot (superficial peroneal nerve) can occur due to the placement of the incisions. Nerve injury can occur due to retraction, direct injury, or from scarring during the recovery process. If these nerves are injured or cut, the patient could end up with numbness or pain along the path of the nerve.<em>Painful Hardware</em>. Pain may be associated with the screws that are used to secure the joints. About 10-20% of people will need to undergo removal of the screws, usually in the subtalar joint, due to discomfort, once the bones have healed.<em>Arthritis of Ankle Joint</em>. Prior to surgery, patients have movement that occurs below the ankle joint; however after surgery, the movement below the ankle joint dissipates and goes through the ankle joint itself, meaning more force is applied in that area. After 10-15 years, patients will see arthritic changes on x-ray, but patients will not necessarily be symptomatic, although it is still a possibility.<br /><p>Edited September 5, 2015</p>

Edited by <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/judith-smith-md/"><em><strong>Judith Smith, MD</strong></em></a><br /><h2>Indication</h2><br />Bone graft can be taken from just below the knee (proximal tibia), on the inside or outside part of the upper leg. This involves an incision about an inch in length (2-4 cm). A hole or window is made in the outer hard bone (cortical bone), and then the soft (cancellous) bone is scooped out and placed around the joint or bone that needs to heal. The wound is then closed up. A proximal tibial bone graft harvest is usually performed on the same side that is being operated on so it does not require creating a second sterile area during surgery, such as occurs when an iliac crest bone graft harvest is performed. This procedure does not affect the stability or function of the knee joint, as it is performed below the knee joint itself. Usually the patient's weight-bearing status post surgery is dictated by the fusion or fracture repair surgery that has been performed, and not by the proximal tibial bone graft harvest.<br /><h2>Potential Complications</h2><br />Potential complications include the usual possible complications associated with surgical procedures, such as:<br /><ul><br />	<li>Infection</li><br />	<li>Wound healing problems (i.e. painful scarring)</li><br /></ul><br /><h2>Specific complications</h2><br />Specific complications associated with the proximal tibial bone graft harvest are rare but could include:<br /><ul><br />	<li>Injury to the knee joint</li><br />	<li>Weakening of the bone which could in theory increase the risk of a tibial fracture</li><br /></ul><br /><p>Edited on January 18, 2016</p>
Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/patrick-oconnor-md-editor" target="_blank">Patrick O’Connor, MD</a></strong></em><br /><h2>Summary</h2><br />A Turf toe is an injury to the great toe joint. It occurs when the great toe is forced upward such as what may occur when an athlete cuts hard on artificial turf. With too much upward force on the great toe, the soft-tissues (capsule) lining the base of the great toe joint is injured or in some instances completely torn. This leads to pain and swelling in the toe. Treatment for partial tears of the capsule includes rest, ice, avoiding aggravating activities, taping or shoes to limit movement.  The recovery can be prolonged -- often for as long as 2-8 weeks or more. Complete ruptures of the capsule require surgery and a prolonged recovery of 4-6 months.<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />Turf toe injuries result in pain at the base of the great toe. They usually occur after an acute injury although repetitive forced upward movement of the great toe may also lead to an injury of the tissue (capsule) stabilizing the great toe joint. Turf toe is commonly seen in contact sports such as football, soccer, and rugby.  It can also occur in high impact sports such as gymnastics and dance.  Commonly an athlete will be changing direction suddenly on the playing field and the great toe will be forced upwards as the foot rolls over the toe which is planted on the ground. With enough force the soft-tissues (capsule) on the under surface of the great toe will be torn either partially or completely. Patients will complain of pain in the great toe, noticeable swelling, a limp, and an inability to run on the foot.<br /><h2>Physical Examination</h2><br />Patients with turf toe injuries will have pain in the great toe region especially at the base of the toe in the sole of the foot (plantar surface). The great toe will often be swollen. Moving the great toe upwards will often create pain. If the capsule is significantly torn the great toe joint may be noted to be unstable. A noticeable limp may be observed as patients try not to load the injured area of their foot.<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />Plain x-rays should be reviewed to rule out other injuries such as <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/sesamoid-stress-fractures/">sesamoid fractures</a> and other fractures involving the great toe. However, x-rays in turf toe injuries are usually negative.<br />A stress x-ray or fluoroscopy may demonstrate excessive movement (instability) of the great toe joint when the great toe joint is stressed.<br />An MRI will reveal evidence of the soft-tissue (capsular) injury.<br /><h2>Classification of Turf Toe injuries</h2><br />A classification system has been presented by Clanton et al in 2007<br />Grade 1: Attenuation of the plantar soft-tissue (capsule) of the great toe<br />Grade 2: Partial tear of the plantar soft-tissue of the great toe<br />Grade 3: Complete tear with instability of the plantar soft-tissue<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br /><h3>Non-Operative Treatment</h3><br />Non-operative treatment is usually effective for grade 1 and 2 turf toe injuries (partial tearing). The principles of treatment are to limit great toe movement while healing occurs and to control the symptoms of pain. Common non-operative treatment includes:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><i>Ice and Elevation</i>: Acute injuries will benefit from ice and elevation to help decrease the swelling and allow for healing</li><br /> 	<li><i>Rest and Activity modification</i>: Patients will initially often have to avoid all activities and in acute severe turf toe injures crutches are often needed.</li><br /> 	<li><i>Limiting great toe motion</i>: A Cast Boot (CAM Walker), or a rigid soled shoe can be used to limit motion through the great toe and protect the injured tissue while it heals. The extent of the injury and the time in the recovery process will usually determine which of these options is chosen. As the individual starts to return to sporting activity they will often benefit from taping the big toe and using a Morton's extension splint. Both of these treatments are designed to limit the motion of the great toe and thereby protect it.</li><br /> 	<li><i>Anti-inflammatory pain medications (NSAIDs)</i>: NSAIDs may be helpful to decrease the pain. Care must be taken to avoid taking too many NSAIDs not only can they be hard on your stomach, but there is some evidence that they may have an adverse effect on soft-tissue healing.</li><br /></ul><br /><h3>Operative Treatment</h3><br />In Turf toe injuries where there is complete tearing of the plantar soft-tissues of the great toe surgical repair may be needed. As well some turf toe injures that do not adequately recover may benefit from turf toe surgery.<br />The surgery involves:<br /><ol><br /> 	<li>Cleaning out any debris (cartilage fragments, etc.) that might be found in the great toe joint</li><br /> 	<li>Repairing the torn soft-tissue (plantar plate or plantar capsule) at the base of the great toe.</li><br /></ol><br />Recovery can be prolonged and often involves:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li>6-8 weeks of non-weight-bearing or limited weight-bearing to allow the soft-tissue repair to heal followed by:</li><br /> 	<li>6-8 weeks of controlled rehabilitation while still protecting the repair in a boot or stiff soled shoe followed by:</li><br /> 	<li>6-8+ weeks of increasing controlled sports-specific exercises</li><br /></ul><br />It is not uncommon for swelling to persist for many months. It is also not uncommon to have some residual symptoms even after a seemingly successful surgery.  Unfortunately for some, a severe turf toe injury could be a career ending injury.<br /><h3>Potential Complications</h3><br />The following general complications can occur:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#infection">Infection</a></strong></em></li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems">Wound healing problems</a></strong></em></li><br /> 	<li>Blood clotting (<em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#dvt">DVT</a></strong></em> or Pulmonary Embolism)</li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#nerve-injury">Neuritis</a></strong></em></li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#crps">Complex regional pain syndrome</a></strong></em></li><br /> 	<li>Persistence of some symptoms due to the underlying joint injury</li><br /></ul><br />Potential complications that are specific to turf toe surgery include:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li>Failure of the joint capsular repair</li><br /> 	<li>Neuritis from an injury to a branch of the medial plantar nerve</li><br /></ul><br /><div></div><br /><p>Edited on November 8, 2016</p>

Edited by<em><strong> <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/jean-brilhault-md-editor/">Jean Brilhaut, MD</a></strong></em><br /><h2>Summary</h2><br />A plantar fibroma is the most common reason for a lump to develop on the arch of the foot. These are often small (less than half an inch), but can grow steadily to reach sizes of 2 inches or more. They may occur as a single lesion or they may present as multiple lesions, typically along the medial border of the plantar fascia.They are benign and are composed of dense, fibrous tissue found in the ligaments. Rapid-growing and multi-planar fibromas are considered plantar fibromatosis.Many patients with plantar fibromas do not have any symptoms and when they do, it is often only a vague discomfort from “walking on a lump”. These masses can be treated non-surgically with a custom or soft accommodating prefabricated (over the counter) orthotic. However, if they grow larger or are a persistent source of discomfort, they should be removed surgically.<br /><h2>History</h2><br />Patients with plantar fibromas will usually report that they “just noticed the mass one day”. Occasionally they will have a history of a similar mass in the palm (Dupytren’s Contracture).  As the mass gets larger, they may report increasing discomfort with prolonged standing.The first thing to look for however is a foreign body reaction from previous penetrating trauma, which is the most common cause of benign tumor of the sole (especially among diabetic patients).Second, although uncommon a malignant synovial sarcoma may cause a fast growing and painful lump on the sole of the foot.<br /><h2>Physical Examination</h2><br />Plantar fibromas lumps that are usually located on the inside of the arch of the foot (Figure 1). The lump usually feels smooth and rubbery. They are not usually tender to touch, although they may become irritated with prolonged walking.<br /><h5>Figure 1:  Large Plantar Fibroma in classic location on the sole of the foot</h5><br />^media_display_589c29f7de9125bcb769322e/position:center^<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br /><h4><em>X-rays</em></h4><br />X-rays are often negative, although if the x-rays are taken in such a way as to highlight the soft-tissues, an outline of a mass may be seen. Calcifications are looked for since it is a sign of malign tumor and would require an MRI.<br /><h4><em>MRI</em></h4><br />An MRI will show a smooth, consistent (homogenous) mass that is affiliated with the plantar fascia (Figure 2). An MRI will confirm the diagnosis and allow differentiation of other causes of masses in the foot, such as lipomas, ganglions, neuromas, herniations of the plantar fasica, and tumors (very rare).<br /><h5>Figure 2:  MRI of a large plantar fibroma</h5><br />^media_display_589c29fbde9125bcb7693231/position:center^<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br /><h3>Non-Operative Treatment</h3><br />Plantar fibromas are typically treated non-operatively, until they cause discomfort to the patient on a regular basis. Non-operative treatment includes:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li>anti-inflammatory medications</li><br /> 	<li>shoe modifications</li><br /> 	<li>the use of a soft-accommodating or well molded custom-made shoe insert</li><br /></ul><br /><h3>Injectable Medications</h3><br />Much of the conservative treatment lacks direct supporting evidence-based medicine and studies to support its efficacy, many of the modalities available derive from Dupuytren’s disease conservative treatment. Injections can shrink the plantar fibroma and reduce the symptomatology whereas excision surgery has a high recurrence rate and increased potential for wound healing issues.Injection is mainly of corticosteroid (15 mg to 30 mg of triamcinolone acetonide in each nodule). A series of three to five injections with each injection spaced three to six weeks apart. However, 50 percent of the patients experienced recurrence within one to three years after their last injection, necessitating one or more additional injections. Secondary effects are transient depigmentation or temporary subcutaneous fat atrophy at the injection site.On the treatment horizon is the possible injection of collagenase.<br /><h3>Operative Treatment</h3><br />Operative treatment is typically avoided due to both the high recurrence rate and the difficulty with obtaining clear margins.  Operative treatment involves excising (cutting out) the mass. This is typically done through an incision in line with the length of the foot. The mass is then sent to be examined by the pathologist to confirm the diagnosis. Recovery and return to unrestricted activity and shoewear is in the one- to two-month range.<br /><h2>Potential complications of surgery</h2><br />Surgery to remove a plantar fibroma can be associated with the usual array of potential complications, including:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em>Recurrence</em>:  These lesions typically involve the overlying skin and dermis, as well as the plantar fascia, and obtaining clean margins is difficult.  As a result, they have a high recurrence rate and in many cases, recur rapidly.  Some authors advocate complete removal of the plantar fascia to reduce the rate of recurrence.  Surgical margins should approach 2 cm. The recurrence rate is significantly higher for plantar fibromatosis and in revision cases. Adjuvant radiation therapy may be indicated to reduce the incidence of recurrence.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Wound healing problems</em>: Wound complications are surprisingly common in this type of surgery, as the lesions typically involve the overlying epidermis and dermis (3-30+% depending on the size of the mass).  Patients should be aware that skin grafting may be necessary.  The larger the mass, the greater the likelihood of a wound problem. A painful scar is always a possibility with surgery on the sole of the foot, although it happens uncommonly.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Infection</em>: Usually occurs in 2-5% of cases,  although it may be higher if a wound problem develops</li><br /> 	<li><em>Nerve injury</em>: 2-5% of patients may have injury or irritation to the nerve on the inside of the sole of the foot (medial branch of the plantar nerve).</li><br /> 	<li><em>Blood clot (DVT)</em>: These are quite uncommon unless there is a specific risk factor for blood clotting.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Pulmonary Embolism</em>: Potentially very serious, but very uncommon unless there is a specific risk factor for blood clotting</li><br /></ul><br /><p>Edited on November 14, 2016 (Originally edited by <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/matthew-buchanan-md-editor" target="_blank"><strong><em>Matt Buchanan, MD</em></strong></a>)</p><br /> 
<h2>(<em>Also known as bracing</em>)</h2><br />Edited by <strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/haley-merrill-md/">Haley Merrill MD</a></strong>Ankle support and stability can often be improved with the use of ankle lacers.  By limiting ankle motion, an ankle lacer may provide improved pain control, and perhaps prevent re-injury in patients who are at risk.  An ankle lacer works similar to taping the ankle and has the advantage of being easier to use, albeit with the disadvantage of less support and greater bulk than typical ankle taping.  Conditions that often benefit from the use of an ankle lacer include: ankle instability (ankle sprains), ankle arthritis, posterior tibial tendon dysfunction, peroneal tendonitis, and ankle impingement.<br /><p><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Ankle-Lacer.png">^media_display_589c29fdde9125bcb7693235/position:center^</a></p><br />There is a wide spectrum of braces that fall into the category of &quot;ankle lacer.&quot;  Some ankle lacers are relatively light and almost flimsy, providing more comfort but perhaps less support, whereas others are bulkier and made of stiffer materials and thereby providing more support.  In general, an ankle lacer can be worn with a regular shoe although often the shoe will have to be loosened to accommodate the ankle lacer.  Most ankle lacers are obtained &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; at medical device stores, pharmacies, or online.  Some ankle lacers, such as the Arizona ankle lacer, are custom made and even provide greater support albeit with more bulk and more expense.Ankle lacers are fitted over a clean sock and then tightened either with laces (thus the name &quot;lacer&quot;) or with Velcro straps.  They can be adjusted to fit the individual patient.  Also, if they are used during sporting type activities, they will often need to be readjusted on a semi-regular basis, as the foot will tend to swell with increased activity level.<br /><p>Edited May 8th, 2016</p>

However, there are times either after an acute injury or following a complex chronic problem, (ex. Diabetic foot infection) where a below-the-knee amputation is not only warranted, but offers the patient the best chance for a more functional, more timely, and often less painful extremity. Patients with a well-fitted below-the-knee prosthesis may be able to function at high level, often without a noticeable limp. However, mobility and function following successful surgery and rehabilitation is often limited by the patient’s pre-surgery level of function. Those that had limited function prior to surgery may also be limited post-surgery. Recovery from a below knee amputation involves wound healing, rehabilitation, and emotional support.<br /><h2>Indications</h2><br />There are a variety of indications for a below knee amputation including:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li>An uncontrolled infection of the foot (ex. a severe diabetic foot infection)</li><br /> 	<li>A traumatic injury to the foot or lower leg that can not be salvaged</li><br /> 	<li>Loss of blood supply to the foot either from trauma or vascular disease</li><br /> 	<li>A chronic foot or ankle injury or deformity that can not be salvaged or reconstructed</li><br /> 	<li>Birth defects</li><br /> 	<li>Malignant bone tumors</li><br /></ul><br /><h2>Procedure</h2><br />The procedure is performed in order to preserve function of the knee joint, to leave a long enough amputation stump to fit a prosthesis, and to provide adequate soft-tissue padding over what would otherwise be a prominent stump of bone. The amputation is typically performed in the middle of the lower leg. However, it should be done at a level that removes all the damaged tissue, which may require a shorter stump.  The skin incision and dissection is typically made significantly longer in the back (posteriorly) of the leg than in the front (anteriorly). This allows the calf muscle to be brought forward, providing padding over the bony stump. The major veins and arteries are identified, tied off and then cut. Nerves are cut short to minimize the risk of painful nerve remnant (neuroma). The major nerves are identified and both the larger bone (tibia) and smaller bone (fibula) of the lower leg are cut with a saw and smoothed. The fibula is usually cut shorter than the tibia. The front of the cut tibia is cut at a slant (beveled) to avoid a sharp ridge of bone at the front of the leg. The amputation is then closed by suturing the layers of tissue together, including often suturing a remnant of what was part of the Achilles tendon to the front of the tibia, to improve stability of the stump.  After surgery, most patients spend 1-2 days in the hospital.<strong><em><a href="/ertl-procedure-tibiofibular-osteosynthesis">Tibiofibular Osteosynthesis or Ertl Procedure</a></em></strong><br /><h2>Recovery</h2><br /><em>Healing Phase (0 thru 6-12 weeks)</em>During the healing phase, the wound of the amputation stump is healing. Sutures are removed when the incision is healed, between 2-6 weeks, which is typically  longer in patients with diabetes.  Swelling is very common following a below knee amputation, and can last several months. Often, a stump shrinker (a sock that provides even pressure to the healing stump) is applied once the sutures have been removed. It is important to keep the knee functioning as normally as possible (including the ability to fully straighten) during the healing phase. It is not uncommon for patients to fall during this phase, as they may momentarily “forget” that they have had their leg amputated.<em>Prosthetic Fitting (8+ weeks)</em>Prosthetic fitting is started once the wound and soft-tissues have healed adequately. A prosthetist is a trained expert who coordinates the prosthetic fitting. This individual needs to work closely with the patient over a number of months to ensure that the prosthesis fits optimally. Initially, a preparatory prosthesis is molded and fit. Patients are encouraged to slowly start walking with support and often begin physical therapy at this time. Initially patients can only wear the prosthesis for short periods of time, but gradually this time period increases. Over time, the amputation stump shrinks from a combination of less swelling and atrophy of the muscles. As this occurs, more and more stump shrinkers need to be added and the socket of the prosthesis needs to be adjusted. When the stump has reached a stable size, usually 6-9 months following the amputation, a “permanent” prosthesis is made.<em>Rehabilitation Phase</em>Learning to walk with the prosthesis, rehabilitating muscles and joints that often have not been used normally for many months is critical for a successful result, following a below knee amputation. Regular physical therapy is essential. Starting with a lot of support (i.e. a walker) and gradually progressing to improve strength, balance, and endurance will help optimize the results. There are often setbacks and patients need to try not to become discouraged when these occur. Often the amputation stump will become irritated in localized areas, requiring the patient to decrease their activities for a period of time. Alterations in the liner and socket of the prosthesis are usually required, so regular visits to the prosthetist are common.<br /><h2>Complications</h2><br />There are a variety of potential complications that can occur following a below knee amputation. These include general post surgical complications, as well as more specific complications such as:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#infection">Infection</a></strong></em></li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems">Wound healing problems</a></strong></em></li><br /> 	<li><strong><em>Neuroma</em></strong></li><br /> 	<li><strong><em>Phantom limb pain</em></strong></li><br /> 	<li><strong><em>Knee contracture</em></strong></li><br /> 	<li><strong><em>Bone spur formation at the amputation site (heterotopic ossification)</em></strong></li><br /> 	<li><strong><em>Difficult with prosthetic fitting</em></strong></li><br /> 	<li><strong><em>Decreased function (increased energy expenditure)</em></strong></li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#dvt">DVT</a></strong></em></li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#pe">Pulmonary embolism</a></strong></em></li><br /></ul><br />By removing unhealthy tissue and creating a leg that is more functional and less painful, a below knee amputation can improve quality of life in many patients.<br /><p>Edited May 29th, 2016</p>
Yes! Heel pain is a common complaint 6-12 weeks after major foot surgery. The pain is usually self-limiting. There can be a couple causes, but the most common is that the heel gets irritated when a person starts to really increase their walking and general weight-bearing after being off their foot for an extended period of time recovering form the foot surgery. The heel has got use to not doing much over the past few months (it atrophies a bit) and does not like being walked on. It let's you know that it is angry with this increased workload with pain and irritation. The solution in this instance is to tough it out and realize that it will get better in 3-6 weeks - once the heel tissue toughens up a bit.The other potential cause is pain from the screw head. If this is the case it can be padded (heel gel pad from a local pharmacy) but ultimately will need screw removal once the bone has healed. 
The prosthetic that is fitted following a below knee amputation is quite functional these days. Design features that were added to the prosthesis in the 1980s helped the prosthesis more closely mirror the function of the normal human foot absorbing force when the foot hits the ground and returning it as the heel rises. As the technology has improved prosthetic design has become lighter, more comfortable, more functional - and more expensive. The prosthetic has four basic components:<br /><h2>1. <em>The liner</em><br /><em> 2. The socket</em><br /><em> 3. The shank</em><br /><em> 4.

It was popularized in Europe and the term originates from an architectural and carpentry term defined as: “a joint made by notching, grooving, or otherwise cutting the ends of two pieces and fastening them together so that they lap over and join firmly into one continuous piece.The scarf osteotomy is preferred by some surgeons because it allows movement of the bone in a number of different planes and can therefore be very versatile.<br /><h2>Operative Procedure:</h2><br />The osteotomy in itself involves a Z-shaped cut in the first metatarsal which can then be moved and fixed in this new position, usually with two small screws The excess bone on the inside of the foot (medial side) is then removed. The procedure to correct hallux valgus also involves a release of the tight ligaments (lateral release) and tightening of the loose ligaments (medial plication) to balance the joint. Often another osteotomy called an Akin is made in the proximal phalynx (first bone of the great toe) to complete the surgical correction.The foot is usually then supported in a bandage and the patient asked to keep weight off the front of the foot for up to 6 weeks.<br /><p><em>Figure 1</em></p><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/SCARF-osteotomy_figure-1.jpg">^media_display_589c29ffde9125bcb7693244/position:center^</a><br /><p><em>Figure 2: Correction &amp; Deformity</em></p><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/SCARF-osteotomy_figure-2.jpg">^media_display_589c2a00de9125bcb7693247/position:center^</a><em>Figure 3 &amp; 4: Before SCARF Osteotomy Bunion Correction (left) and after SCARF Osteotomy Bunion Correction</em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/SCARF-osteotomy_figure-3.jpg">^media_display_589c2a02de9125bcb769324a/position:center^</a><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/SCARF-osteotomy_figure-4.jpg">^media_display_589c2a03de9125bcb769324d/position:center^</a><br /><p>Edited January 4, 2016</p>
 
Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/timothy-charlton-md-editor" target="_blank">Timothy Charlton, MD</a></strong></em><br /><h2>Summary</h2><br />High ankle sprains are less common than regular <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/sprained-ankle">ankle sprains</a></strong></em>, but when they occur they are often more debilitating. They occur from a twisting injury to the ankle when the foot is planted on the ground. This results in partial tearing of the ligaments that hold the two bones of the lower leg together, at the level of the ankle. Pain and swelling on the outside front part of the ankle are the main symptoms. A marked limp or inability to weight-bear is common initially. Treatment is typically rest and immobilization to allow for healing of the injured ligaments. It will often take many weeks or even months to fully recover from high ankle sprain.<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />Patients with a high ankle sprain describe an acute twisting injury to the ankle, leading to pain and swelling in the front outside part of the ankle. Unlike a typical ankle sprain, the foot is usually rotated outwardly (externally), typically with the foot planted on the ground. However, a high ankle sprain can also occur in combination with a severe ankle sprain.  Pain following a high ankle sprain can be quite localized, and can lead to a marked limp or to the inability to bear weight. These injuries often occur in a sporting event, where there is a sudden change of direction, and an excessive applied force, such as being tackled while playing football. In severe high ankle sprains, there may be generalized ankle swelling and even tenderness on the inside of the ankle.<br /><h2>Physical Examination</h2><br />On exam, the ankle may demonstrate moderate, to severe swelling after the acute event. Most of this swelling will be centered over the front outside (anterolateral) part of the ankle. Pressing on this area will reveal significant localized tenderness to the front and outside of ankle. With time, the swelling will settle, but the point of tenderness may remain. Often, the ankle motion will be restricted, especially with bringing the foot upwards (dorsiflexion). Certain maneuvers or special tests will reproduce or aggravate the symptoms. For example, the squeeze test is performed by squeezing the two bones of the lower legs (tibia and fibula) together, approximately four inches above the ankle joint. This test will tend to reproduce the symptoms in the front, outside part of the ankle in patients who have had a high ankle sprain. The external rotation test involves twisting the foot to the outside, thereby stressing the outer part of the ankle. This will also reproduce symptoms.<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />Plain x-rays of the ankle rarely demonstrate any abnormalities. Occasionally, with a severe high ankle sprain, a stress view (force applied to the heel in an outward direction) will show some displacement and separation of the tibia and fibula (syndesmosis) at the level of the ankle joint, although this is uncommon.An MRI may demonstrate an injury to the ligament in the outside front part of the ankle, which holds the two bones of the lower leg (tibia and fibula) together (the anterior inferior tibiofibular ligament). This ligament is typically partially or entirely disrupted in a high ankle sprain.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br /><h3>Non-Operative Treatment</h3><br />Most high ankle sprains can be treated non-surgically. However, as the ankle joint is required to withstand a fair amount of force with each step, it often takes  quite a while to make a full recovery from a high ankle sprain. Non-operative treatment consists of relative immobilization, often in a walker boot, while using crutches. Time then is required to allow the injured ligaments to heal. It’s not uncommon for 6 to 10 weeks or more to be required for satisfactory healing of the ligamentous injury, to reach the point where the individual is able to return to active, unrestricted cutting sports. Taping the ankle may allow an earlier return to activities, albeit with some loss of motion and function. The initial phases of treatment are oriented towards pain control and limiting swelling. This often takes a few weeks to settle. The next phase of recovery is focused on maintaining ankle motion and keeping the muscles of the lower leg firing and active as much as possible. The final phase is a sport specific return to activity, with the use of ankle taping and a graduated return to activity. A focus on proprioceptive exercise is important, particularly in the final phase of rehabilitation.<br /><h3>Surgical Treatment</h3><br />Occasionally, the ligaments holding the syndesmosis together will be completely or significantly disrupted. In this instance, it may be necessary to reduce the syndesmosis, and stabilize it with screws or some other type of fixation. A direct repair of the syndesmotic ligaments, as well as a cleaning out (debridement) of the ankle joint may be indicated. Fortunately, the vast majority of high ankle sprains do not require surgery.A certain percentage of patients suffering from a high ankle sprain will have ongoing residual symptoms months after their injury. If this is the case, an investigation (ex. and MRI) to assess for damage to the ankle joint itself (intra-articular injury) should be performed. It’s not uncommon to have an associated anterolateral impingement that stems from a high ankle sprain, leading to scarring of the lower fibers of the anterior, inferior tibio-fibular ligament.<br /><p>Edited on November 22, 2016</p><div></div>
 
Edited by <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/hussein-pazkad-md/"><em><strong>Hossein Pakzad, MD</strong></em></a><br /><h2>Summary</h2><br />The metatarsals are the long bones in the forefoot that lead up to the toes.  Metatarsal shaft fractures are common injuries, and cause pain and swelling in the mid and forefoot. They are typically caused by a trauma, such as the drop of a heavy object on the foot, or the sudden bend of the forefoot (i.e. a trip and fall on uneven ground). Metatarsal shaft fractures can also be caused by direct loading and twisting of the foot, such as what might occur in an automobile accident. When bones are fragile (Osteoporosis), it takes minimal trauma to cause these types of fractures, such as a miss-step or a sudden twisting movement. In addition to acute fractures of the metatarsals, repetitive intense activity (i.e. military marching) or a change in intensity of a particular acitivity can lead to a “<em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/stress-fractures">stress fracture</a></strong></em>” of one of the metatarsals.   Most metatarsal shaft fractures can be treated non-surgically, with limited weightbearing in a stiff-soled shoe or a boot for 6 to 8 weeks, provided that the bones are in an acceptable position.  Some displaced fractures will benefit from surgery to reposition and stabilize the bones.<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />Metatarsals are the five long bones that connect the forefoot to the midfoot.  A break (fracture) in one or more of the metatarsals is often associated with significant swelling, and also pain in the arch of the foot or at the pads of the forefoot.  Usually the soft tissue overlying the bones remains intact, but in some instances, the bones will break through the skin, creating an open injury, which is a surgical emergency. Common mechanisms for having metatarsal shaft fracture(s) include falling from a high height and landing on the feet, jamming the foot into the brake pedals in the course of a motor vehicle collision, loading the foot and twisting it in the course of changing directions during a sporting event, and most commonly, dropping a heavy object on the forefoot. Based on the quality of bone, less aggressive trauma may also cause fractures in a patient who is suffering from osteoporosis.<br /><h2>Physical Exam</h2><br />In the case of an isolated metatarsal shaft fracture, there will be tenderness and swelling localized to the injured area. In the case of multiple metatarsal fractures, the painful, swollen area will be larger and will correlate to the involved bones. During the acute phase of the injury, there may be bruising that extends toward the toes. There may also be some numbness in the toes. The purpose of the exam is to assess the position of the toes, the toe alignment, as well as the blood supply to the toes.It is important to assess the position of the metatarsal heads. These are the ends of the metatarsals that represent the “ball of the foot”. This is the area that we walk on, and it is possible to have a problematic position of the metatarsal head, resulting from a displaced metatarsal fracture.<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />Plain x-rays of the foot will usually identify the fracture (Figure 1). The location and pattern of the fracture will be identified and assessed, along with the position of nearby bony architecture. The rotation and angulation at the fracture site are all things that the treating physician will need to consider. In the case of a metatarsal stress fracture, the original x-ray may report and read as normal, so often a second x-ray is recommended when there is strong clinical evidence showing the presence of a metatarsal shaft fracture. An additional x-ray 3-4 weeks post injury is helpful in identifying how healing is progressing in the affected bone.<br /><h5>Figure 1: Metatarsal Fractures on X-ray</h5><br />^media_display_589c2a07de9125bcb7693255/position:center^<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br />Most metatarsal fractures can be treated non-surgically.  If the fractured metatarsals are in an acceptable position, they can be treated without surgery. In rare occasions, manipulation of the bone to reposition them in an acceptable position is necessary.  Occasionally, an “open reduction internal fixation” procedure is required to stabilize the bone. This may involve placement of small plates and/or screws, or using pins to realign the bone. Multiple metatarsal fractures are rare and normally are treated with restricted weight bearing. Walking on an injured foot with multiple metatarsal fractures is not recommended, and may cause further displacement of the broken bones and ultimately cause the need for surgical intervention.Treatment of a single metatarsal fracture involves protecting the injured foot until the bone is healed. During this time, limited weight bearing in a stiff soled boot or a very stiff soled shoe is recommended to support the fracture. It typically takes 6-8 weeks for the bone to heal  and get strong enough for the patient to resume full weight bearing in a normal shoe. Despite being able to walk, patients with a metatarsal fracture are advised to avoid excessive walking, especially on uneven ground, to eliminate the risk of displacement. It is often 4 to 6 months before a full recovery is obtained (ex. return to unrestricted activities such as jumping and sprinting). Smoking slows down the bone healing process and normally fracture healing is slower in smokers. Smoking cessation is recommended to all patients with broken bones. Taking daily vitamin D and calcium is also recommended.Surgery may be indicated in the case of either a significantly displaced metatarsal shaft fracture, or in the case of multiple displaced metatarsal shaft fractures (Figure 2). There is some suggestion that surgical stabilization for a displaced metatarsal shaft fracture can produce a slightly faster recovery time, albeit with the associated risks of surgery. These risks include infection and residual numbness around the toe or surgical site. In rare cases, excessive scar formation around the surgical site may cause toe deformity in the longterm.<br /><h5>Figure 2: Surgical Stabilization of Metatarsal Fractures</h5><br />^media_display_589c2a09de9125bcb7693258/position:center^<br /><p align="right">Edited on January 22, 2016 (Originally edited by <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/gwyneth-devries-md-frcsc-editor" target="_blank"><strong><em>Gwyneth DeVries, MD FRCSC</em></strong></a>)</p><br />  
<h4>Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/kenneth-j-hunt-md-editor" target="_blank">Kenneth Hunt, MD</a></strong></em></h4><br /><h2>Summary</h2><br />Metal screws and plates are often used in surgery to fix fractures, fuse joints, or stabilize bones that have been cut (osteotomies) in the foot and ankle. In most instances, these screws and plates do not create symptoms, and remain permanently in the foot. However, in some patients, hardware can become prominent or irritate a nearby tendon or other soft tissues. Some patients also complain of achiness in the foot or ankle related to weather changes. Initially, this may be treated with shoe modifications, padding over the area, and simple measures to reduce the local swelling and inflammation.  However, if this is not satisfactory, patients may benefit from painful hardware removal once the fracture, fusion, or bone cut has fully healed.<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />Patients that have previously had surgery to fix a fracture or to fuse a bone of the foot and ankle may have retained hardware that can become prominent and/or creates discomfort.  While most retained hardware is asymptomatic, some patients will develop symptoms.  The symptoms can be due to a screw or plate that rubs against a boot, or pain may be produced when the tendon or soft tissue structure rubs against the prominent screw or plate. When patients are recovering from the original injury or surgery, the symptoms and swelling are such that the hardware is usually not a significant issue. However, over time when the swelling settles, hardware can become prominent and in some instances, may need to be removed. No implants used in foot and ankle surgery will set off an airport metal detector. However, some patients will complain of achiness in the foot or ankle related to weather changes.<br /><h2>Physical Exam</h2><br />On exam, the hardware can usually be palpated under the skin. There may be a bursa (fluid filled sac of tissue) or an area of inflammation associated with the area. The symptoms can often be reproduced with motion of the joint or movement of nearby tendons.<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />X-rays will reveal the hardware if it is metal (most screws are stainless steel).  X-rays may also identify the area of the hardware which is likely to be causing the symptoms. Occasionally prominent, non-absorbent sutures or other forms of retained surgical material may create symptoms but may not show up on x-rays. These objects are generally not seen on x-ray (radiolucent). MRI scans are rarely useful for painful metal implants since metal causes “artifact”, which prevents visualization of neighboring tissues, or even the entire foot.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br />Most hardware that is placed to fix a fracture or fuse a joint does not need to be removed and, in fact, will not cause any symptoms. In most instances, it is either retained within the bone or is not particularly prominent with adequate covering of soft tissues. However, with some individuals and with some types of surgeries, symptoms may arise.  In this instance, symptoms can be treated with local padding, such as wearing a thick sock or using a local gel pad. A change in shoes or modification of existing shoes may also be helpful. If this is not acceptable for symptom relief, then consideration should be given to removing the hardware after the fracture or fusion has fully healed.<br /><h4>Surgical Removal</h4><br />Surgery to remove metal implants is usually performed on an ambulatory or outpatient basis (i.e., go home the same day). For many implants, this can be done under regional or local anesthesia (i.e., a “nerve block”), which means that you can stay awake (if you want) for the procedure and not feel anything. The same incisions used for the original surgery are typically used for the removal procedure. Many of the same peri-operative risks apply for hardware removal, as for any surgical procedure.  Certain foot and ankle operations have a higher rate of needing hardware removal than others.

<h2>Summary</h2><br />Plantar fascia rupture is characterized by an acute pain in the arch of the foot, following a dynamic activity. It is a relatively uncommon injury but can occur in patients with<em> <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/plantar-fasciitis/">chronic plantar fasciitis</a></em>. It is often associated with long-standing <em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/biomechanics-of-foot-and-ankle/foot-types/characteristics-of-flat-foot/">flat feet deformity</a></em>. Treatment is non-operative, with pain control, relative rest, gentle stretching, and a gradual return to activities over a period of weeks to months.<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />Plantar fascia rupture is an uncommon, but very painful event. Patients will describe a sharp, tearing pain in the sole of their foot, usually during some sort of athletic or dynamic type of activity. It is often associated with a history of flat feet and may be associated with a history of <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/plantar-fasciitis/">plantar fasciitis</a>. Occasionally, there are some symptoms in this area prior to the rupture. After the event, patients will complain of localized pain and associated swelling. It will be very difficult to walk on the foot, and there will be a marked associated limp that will gradually settle over time.<br /><h2>Physical Exam</h2><br />Physical exam will reveal acute tenderness in the sole of the foot, associated with the area of the rupture. There is usually some initial swelling. There may be significant bruising, which appears a few days after the rupture. In addition to identifying a history of flat feet, there may also be a noticeable tightness in the calf muscle (<em>equinus contracture</em>), which has been known to predispose to plantar fascia rupture.<br /><h5>Figure 1:  Bruising in the sole of the foot after plantar facia rupture</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Plantar-Fascia-Rupture-Exam.png">^media_display_589c2a0bde9125bcb769325d/position:center^</a><br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />X-rays taken of the foot will generally be normal.If an MRI is ordered, it will identify the rupture of the plantar fascia, which can be partial or complete. There will be associated edema and evidence of increased blood flow to this area. Of note, the rupture is often in the arch of the foot as opposed to the area that is injured with plantar fasciitis, which is essentially where the plantar fascia attaches (<em>inserts</em>) into the heel bone (<em>calcaneus</em>).<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br />Treatment is non-operative. The injury is usually quite painful and therefore initial treatment is generally oriented towards pain control with ice, crutches, and limited activity. As the symptoms begin to settle, often 4-10 days after the original injury, it may be possible to do more weight bearing, provided that stiff soled comfort shoes or a protective walker boot is used. At this point, gentle plantar stretching can be done.  <em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/non-operative-treatment/non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory-drugs-nsaids/">Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication(s)</a></em> or pain medication can help with the symptoms. Return to reasonably normal standing or walking can occur relatively quickly in a few weeks. However, return to high level sports requiring sudden change of direction or explosive power through the plantar fascia region can be quite prolonged, in the order months.There is usually no surgical indication for treatment of a plantar fascia rupture.<br /><p>Edited on December 28, 2016</p>
<p>Edited by  <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/stephen-pinney-md-editor-in-chief" target="_blank"><em><strong>Stephen Pinney</strong></em><em><strong>, MD</strong></em></a></p><h2>Summary</h2><br />A lateral process fracture of the talus is a fracture of the lower bone of the ankle on the outside (lateral) aspect of this bone.  It typically occurs when the foot is jammed suddenly, and the outside of the lower ankle bone (talus) is pushed heavily against the adjoining bone (fibula).  This can occur in activities such as snowboarding and has lead to this being called a &quot;snowboarder's fracture&quot;.  It is associated with pain and swelling.  The patient will often have difficulty walking and may not be able to put weight on the leg.  If the fracture is not displaced, it may be treated with immobilization for 6-8 weeks, until the fracture has healed.  If the fracture is displaced, surgery is usually required to stabilize the fracture with screws or to remove the fracture fragments.<br /><h5>Figure 1- Fracture of the Lateral Process of the Talus</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/lateral-process-of-talus-11.jpg">^media_display_589c2a0cde9125bcb7693261/position:center^</a><br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />Patients with lateral talar fractures will usually describe an acute injury where their ankle gets jammed on the outside (lateral side).  This could occur when a snowboarder stops suddenly, for example.  Patients will have pain and swelling in the ankle, particularly over the outside aspect.  They will have difficulty walking or be unable to weight-bear.<br /><h2>Physical Examination</h2><br />On examination, patients with a lateral process fracture of the talus will have tenderness and swelling over the outside of the ankle, towards the front.  The findings can be similar to a severe ankle sprain.  Often they will be unable to weight bear.  Moving the ankle may increase the pain, and in some cases may cause a cracking sound.<br /><h2>Imaging Studies<b>  </b></h2><br />It may be possible to see the fracture on a plain x-ray view of the ankle; however, these fractures can be quite subtle on plain x-rays and may be missed.  They can be seen fairly easily on a CT scan or MRI, one of which is often ordered if there are questions as to the nature of the injury.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br />If the fracture itself is completely non-displaced, it can be treated with relative immobilization of six weeks to allow adequate healing in a cast or walker boots.  Once x-rays demonstrate adequate healing, activities can be gradually increased.  It is often 3-6 months or more before a full recovery is achieved.Many lateral talar process fractures are displaced or potentially unstable enough to require surgical fixation.  If surgery is indicated, the fracture area is opened up through incision on the outside front of the ankle, and a screw or screws are placed into the fracture to stabilize it to larger part of the talar body (Figure 2).Occasionally, the fracture will be broken into many pieces (comminuted) that cannot be adequately fixed.  In this case, it may be necessary to remove these bone fragments by cleaning out these fragments (debridement) of the ankle.<br /><h5>Figure 2- Surgical Fixation of the Lateral Process Fracture of the Talus</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/lateral-Process-of-Talus.jpg">^media_display_589c2a0cde9125bcb7693264/position:center^</a><br /><h2>Recovery</h2><br />Typically, recovery time from surgery requires six to eight weeks of relative immobilization and non-weight bearing,  if the fracture has been stabilized (fixed with screws).  If the fracture fragments were just cleaned out (debrided), then weight bearing can be started once the patient feels comfortable.  This is an injury that will often take many months to reach its point of maximum improvement.<br /><h2>Potential Complications</h2><br />Potential complications of surgery include general complications such as:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#infection">Infection</a></strong></em></li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems">Wound healing problem</a></strong></em></li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#nerve-injury">Nerve (sural nerve) damage</a></strong></em></li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#dvt">DVT</a></strong></em></li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#pe"><strong>Pulmonary embolism</strong></a></strong></em></li><br /></ul><br /><h2>Specific Complications</h2><br />Complications that are specific to surgery for a lateral talus process include:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><strong><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/painful-hardware">Painful hardware</a></em></strong>.  Occasionally, hardware (ex. screws) that was used to stabilize the fracture will require removal at a later date.</li><br /> 	<li><strong><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications">Nonunion</a>.</em></strong>  Sometimes the fracture fragments will fail to heal and need to be removed.</li><br /> 	<li><i><strong>Arthritis of the Ankle or Subtalar joint</strong>: </i>These joints are affected by this injury and may develop arthritis secondary to injury at a later date.

Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/paul-juliano-md-editor">Paul Juliano, MD</a></strong></em><br /><h2>Summary</h2><br />5th metatarsal neck fractures result in pain and swelling in the outside part of the forefoot. They occur following an acute injury, often from jamming and twisting the foot against a solid object. The fracture occurs at the weak area of the bone. Treatment is usually non-operative in a walker boot, with limited mobilization through the heel. Occasionally the fracture will need to be repositioned so that it heals in an appropriate position.<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />An acute injury to the outside part of the front of the foot (base of the little toe) may lead to a 5th metatarsal neck fracture. Symptoms will include pain, swelling, and great difficulty walking. Typically the injury will occur from a direct blow, such as dropping an object on the foot, or from jamming the outside of the foot against a solid object, often with an associated twisting motion.<br /><h2>Physical Examination</h2><br />Physical examination will identify swelling in the outside part of the forefoot. The area will be painful to touch. If the fracture is displaced, the bone (5th Metatarsal head) may be prominently positioned, creating a lump against the skin either on top of the foot or in sole of the foot. There may be some sensation of numbness or tingling in the 5th toe. Very rarely will the blood supply to the 5th toe be affected.<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />X-ray of the foot will reveal the fracture. This will allow the physician to determine if the fracture is displaced, and whether the fracture position is acceptable to allow non-surgical treatment.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br /><h3>Non-Operative Treatment</h3><br />Treatment of 5th metatarsal neck fractures is usually non-operative. If the fracture is not displaced or only minimally displaced, it will be treated with rest and immobilization to allow healing. Relative immobilization in a stiff sole shoe or <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/cam-walker-walking-boot">walker boot</a></strong></em> for 6-8 weeks to allow for appropriate healing is usually adequate.  However, full recovery of function often takes many months.If the bone is sufficiently out of position, it will need to be manipulated into a better position. Whether there is excessive displacement of the fracture is usually determined by the surgeon, based on the clinical examination and the x-ray findings.  If the bone is going to heal in a flexed position, or if allowing it to heal in its present position will cause a permanent lump on the bottom or side of the foot, then manipulating it back into a better position is indicated.  A manipulation involves moving the bone into an improved position, and may be done under local anesthetic. Once this has been done, typical non-operative treatment of relative immobilization and time to allow healing is instituted.<br /><h3>Surgical Treatment</h3><br />Occasionally the fracture will be markedly displaced and surgery will be required. In this instance, the fracture may be manipulated back into place and stabilized with a wire (pin). In rare instances, it may be necessary to open up the fracture and put a small plate on the fracture in order to stabilize it in an improved position. Once this has been done, the typical recovery again involves a period of immobilization in a stiff sole shoe or walker boot for 6 or more weeks, allowing for appropriate healing. The total recovery time before complete unrestricted activities may be resumed is often 6 months or more.<br /><p>Edited on November 30, 2016</p><br /> <br /><h2><strong><br /></strong></h2>
Edited by<b> <em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/matthew-buchanan-md-editor" target="_blank">Matthew Buchanan, MD</a></em></b><br /><h2>Summary</h2><br />A corn is a prominent, painful thickening of skin, usually associated with the web spaces between the small toes or the ball of the foot.  Corns are often related to increased skin pressure caused by bony prominences that irritate the skin, causing thickened skin to develop.  Non-operative treatment is usually successful and is oriented towards off-loading the callused area with various pads and spacers.  Surgery is rarely indicated, but when it is, the goals include addressing the underlying reason why the corn has developed –usually removing a prominent bone spur and possibly straightening the affected joint of the involved toe.<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />Patients with corns describe a painful lump on one of their smaller toes or on the ball of their foot.  This can be quite uncomfortable, as it often rubs right up against the adjacent toe or is painful when walking.<br /><h2>Physical Examination</h2><br />Clinical examination will identify a callused area on the side of the involved toe or on the ball of the foot. The area is often painful to touch.  In advanced cases, there may be a breakdown in the thickened skin, leading to discharge and potentially an open wound. There is often a prominent bone underlying this thickened skin region.  This bony prominence is usually the reason the corn has formed.  Corns are typically associated with the joints in the small toe, but can also affect the ball of the foot.<br /><h2>Imaging Study</h2><br />Occasionally it is helpful to perform an x-ray of the affected foot.  This can allow identification of an associated bony prominence and allows checking the status of the nearby joints of the toes and foot.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br /><h3>Non-Operative Treatment</h3><br />Treatment is usually non-operative and is oriented towards protecting the painful area of thickened skin.  Non-operative treatment typically includes:<br /><h4><i> A padded corn sleeve: </i></h4><br />This is a protective sleeve that slides over the toe, covering the corn.  Essentially it provides padding to disperse the force from the surrounding toes over a wider area, thereby reducing the load on the corn.<br /><h4><i>Toe spacers: </i></h4><br />Small toe spacers can be placed between the involved toes to help reduce pressure on the corn.  This can improve symptoms significantly.  These can be made from a variety of materials, including gel, foam, and lamb's wool.<br /><h4><i>Corn donut (doughnut): </i></h4><br />Padded donut-shaped device that surrounds the corn, distributing pressure to a wider area while off-loading the painful central area.<strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/metatarsal-pads/"><i>Metatarsal pads</i></a></strong><i>: </i>Metatarsal pads come in a variety of shapes and sizes, and are strategically placed on the ball of your foot to reduce the pressure affecting the painful corn.<br /><h4><i>Regular trimming of calluses:</i></h4><br />If the corn is associated with a large callus, this can be trimmed or shaved back resulting in an immediate improvement in symptoms.  For many corns, it is often best to have this done by a trained healthcare professional.  Unfortunately, trimming the callus does not address the underlying reason why the corn has formed.  Therefore, the corn usually reoccurs in a matter of weeks requiring repeated trimming.<br /><h3>Surgical Treatment</h3><br />Occasionally, surgery is required to address a painful corn that has failed an attempt at non-operative management.  The surgery is oriented towards addressing any bony prominence associated with the development of the corn, either on the involved toe, adjacent toe, or ball of the foot area.  At the time of surgery, it may also be necessary to straighten out one of the associated small joints (interphalangeal joints) of the involved toe.  This can be quite successful in addressing the corn, but it is also associated with the problems inherent in operating on the foot, specifically that there is now going to be excessive swelling in this area and that there is the very real potential for a complication such as: <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#infection">infection</a>, <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems">wound healing problems</a>, <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#nerve-injury">nerve injury</a>, <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#vascular-injury">vascular injury</a>, and associated joint stiffness.<br /><p align="right">Edited on January 10, 2017</p>
<h2>Summary</h2><br />Lateral column overload is a somewhat non-specific condition that leads to pain in the outside part of the midfoot. It results from excessive loading through the bones on the outside part of the foot (calcaneus, cuboid, 5th metatarsals) It’s often associated with a <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/biomechanics-of-foot-and-ankle/foot-types/characteristics-of-high-arched-foot-subtle-cavus/">high arched foot</a> or a very <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/biomechanics-of-foot-and-ankle/foot-types/characteristics-of-flat-foot/">flat foot</a>, as both of these conditions will increase the force through this part of the foot. Treatment is usually non-operative, with a focus on protecting the area and dispersing force away from this area with the use of comfort shoes or orthotics.<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />Pain in the outside mid-part of the foot, aggravated by standing and walking, is characteristic of conditions that lead to lateral column overload. Symptoms will often be chronic in nature, without necessarily inciting injury. Typically, patients will have a high arched foot or a flat foot. In either situation, this can lead to excessive force through the outside mid-part of the foot. The clinical presentation of this condition can be similar to other conditions that produce pain on the outside of the foot, such as <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/peroneal-tendonitis/">peroneal tendonitis</a> or <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/acquired-adult-flatfoot-deformity-posterior-tibial-tendon-dysfunction/">flat foot deformity</a> with lateral impingement, or even a <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/jones-fracture-5th-metatarsal-stress-fracture/">stress fracture of the 5th metatarsal</a>.<br /><h2>Physical Examination</h2><br />Pain will be localized to the outside midfoot. There is often an associated foot deformity, such as noticeable <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/biomechanics-of-foot-and-ankle/foot-types/characteristics-of-flat-foot/">flat foot</a> or a <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/biomechanics-of-foot-and-ankle/foot-types/characteristics-of-high-arched-foot-subtle-cavus/">high arched</a> foot. Pain may be exacerbated by manipulation of the joints of the outside midfoot (the calcaneal cuboid and the cuboid 4-5 metatarsal).<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />X-rays are typically taken of the foot. They are often negative, other than identifying any type of foot shape (flat foot or high arched). X-rays will rule out damage, such as arthritis to the calcaneal cuboid joint, as well as <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/jones-fracture-5th-metatarsal-stress-fracture/">stress fracture of the 5th metatarsal</a>.An MRI or bone scan will potentially reveal areas of increased loading activity, either in the anterior calcaneus or cuboid.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br />Treatment for this condition is usually non-operative. It is designed to minimize the force that is going through the outside part of the midfoot. This can be done by modifying the shoeware to have a <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/non-operative-treatment/comfort-shoes/">comfort shoe</a>, which disperses forces away from this area of the foot. Appropriate orthotics to help offload the outside part of the foot may be beneficial. This could include an orthotic with a recessed 1st metatarsal head area for patients with a flat foot, or an <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/foot-and-ankle-medical-supplies/pre-fabricated-over-the-counter-orthotics-insert/">over-the-counter medial arch support</a> for patients with flatter feet.Mobilization of the calcaneal cuboid joint through range of motion exercises or occasionally through physical therapy manipulation, may be beneficial if this joint is involved.<br /><p>Edited January 4, 2017 by <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/stephen-pinney-md-editor-in-chief/">Stephen Pinney MD</a></p><br /> 
<h2>Summary</h2><br />Plantar warts are a common skin condition affecting the sole of the foot, particularly near the base of the toes. They are usually asymptomatic. Plantar warts will often resolve spontaneously over time. They are caused by a virus. If they are symptomatic, they can be treated by local chemicals to eradicate the plantar warts. Occasionally, liquid nitrogen treatment through a health care provider will be necessary.<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />Plantar warts are a relatively common problem that can afflict the feet. They usually develop on the sole of the foot and present as an essentially painless abnormal thickening of the skin. Occasionally, they can become large and uncomfortable, even leading to an ulcer, although this is unusual. Plantar warts are caused by a virus and will often resolve spontaneously. The virus is felt to be transmitted through moist surfaces, such as walking around in bare feet in a public change room.<br /><h2>Physical Examination</h2><br />Physical examination reveals an abnormal collection of skin which can be hard but is usually painless to touch. Plantar warts are often located over the sole of the foot, particularly in the area of the forefoot. A plantar wart is often mistaken for a callus that occurs secondary to repetitive overload, such as what is seen in <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/metatarsalgia/">metatarsalgia</a></strong></em>.<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />Imaging studies are usually not indicated as x-rays in most studies will be normal.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br /><h3>Non-Operative Treatment</h3><br />Treatment is often just the passage of time for small plantar warts that are non-symptomatic. Over time these warts will have a tendency to resolve. For larger warts, over the counter contact treatment that is aimed at dissolving away the warts may be helpful. For larger warts that are persistent, the use of liquid nitrogen by a health care provider will create local death of the skin cells. This often will help resolve the plantar wart. However, this treatment is associated with some discomfort and the wart may reoccur.<br /><h3>Surgical Treatment</h3><br />Surgical treatment is generally not indicated. In some instances, trimming back the wart and the excessive thickened skin associated with it may be helpful.<br /><p>Edited on December 21, 2016</p>
Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/paul-juliano-md-editor" target="_blank">Paul Juliano, MD</a></strong></em><br /><h2>Summary</h2><br />Overload heel pain syndrome is an uncommon cause of heel pain, unlike <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/plantar-fasciitis">plantar fasciitis</a></strong></em> which is by far the most common cause. However, there are some patients that have overload heel pain syndrome as the primary source of their heel pain. These individuals will have pain that is centrally located in the heel rather than towards the inside of the heel pad, such as is typical in <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/plantar-fasciitis">plantar fasciitis</a></strong></em>. Individuals with certain foot patterns, such as <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/characteristics-of-high-arched-foot-subtle-cavus">high arched feet</a></strong></em>, relative weakness of the calf muscle, or dysfunction of the Achilles tendon, may be predisposed to overloading the heel with resulting symptoms. In addition, thin soft tissue padding (fat pad atrophy) over the heel may also lead to these symptoms.  Diagnosis is usually based on patient history and clinical examination. Treatment is almost invariably non-operative and focuses on increasing the padding over this area, helping to disperse the forces away from the tissue, as well as avoiding aggravating activities, and weight loss if necessary.<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />Patients with overload heel pain syndrome have significant symptoms of pain directly at the base of their heel. Most heel pain is related to<em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/plantar-fasciitis"> plantar fasciitis</a></strong></em>. However, overload heel pain syndrome can also be a source of significant heel pain. In overload heel pain syndrome, essentially the soft tissues and bone directly under the heel bone (calcaneus) are aggravated by direct repetitive pressure from standing and walking. Factors which predispose an individual to overload heel pain syndrome include:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li>a prominent heel</li><br /> 	<li>thin soft tissue overlying the bone of the heel</li><br /> 	<li>certain foot shapes (ex. <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/characteristics-of-high-arched-foot-subtle-cavus">high arches</a></strong></em>)</li><br /> 	<li>excessive weight.</li><br /></ul><br /><h2>Physical Examination</h2><br />Physical examination will localize the tenderness centrally in the heel pad. This is more central than the pain that is characteristic of plantar fasciitis, which is slightly more to the inside but still in the heel area (Figure 1). Individuals with overload heel pain syndrome will often have increased ankle dorsiflexion (the ability to move the foot up towards the shin). This makes the heel more prominent. This area of pain is differentiated from pain related to interstitial <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/achilles-tendinitis">Achilles tendonitis</a></strong></em>, pump bumps, <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/posterior-heel-pain">retrocalcanceal bursitis</a></strong></em> and <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/plantar-fasciitis">plantar fasciitis</a></strong></em>. Excessive weight may also be present.Figure 1- Overload Heel Pain Syndrome -common location of pain<a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Figure-1-Overload-Heel-Pain-Location-of-Symptoms-copy.png">^media_display_589c2a0ede9125bcb769326c/position:center^</a><br /><h2>Imaging Study</h2><br />A Harris mat or other method of measuring the pressure that the foot absorbs while walking will often show an intense localized force concentrated on the heel area (Figure 2).<br /><h5>Figure 2:  Harris Mat showing concentrated load over the heel region</h5><br />^media_display_589c2a0fde9125bcb769326f/position:center^Often plain x-rays are normal, although they may demonstrate an increased calcaneal pitch angle (the angle of which the lower part of the heel bone meets the floor). In some instances, there may be a small bone spur that points towards the floor. This is different than the characteristic bone spur that may be seen with plantar fasciitis.An MRI may reveal an increased area of edema, and possibly a bursa (fluid filled sac) over the prominent area of the heel. An MRI may also reveal less fatty tissue and soft tissue over the heel.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br /><h3>Non-Operative Treatment</h3><br />Treatment is usually non-operative. It involves allowing the heel area to be protected from increased repetitive loading, allowing the tissues in this area to heal. This can be done by limiting standing and walking. In marked cases, relative immobilization in a walker or cast may be beneficial for a short period of time.  Because of atrophy of the fat pad, the use of a gel pad or other padding to absorb the shock and disperse the force over a wider area will be beneficial.<br /><h3>Surgical Treatment</h3><br />Surgical treatment is reserved for very unusual situations. If there is a prominent spike of bone that is a source of symptoms, this could be removed. However, this is unusual. In addition, if the foot pattern is markedly abnormal, such as might occur in a cavovarus foot or a patient that has an incompetent Achilles tendon, then a reconstructive surgery to address these issues may indirectly help the overload heel pain.<br /><p>Edited on December 1st 2016</p>
Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/lance-silverman-md-editor" target="_blank">Lance Silverman, MD</a></strong></em><br /><h2>Summary</h2><br />The human foot has numerous combinations of dozens of different sesamoid bones. The largest and most commonly injured are the two bones beneath the great toe. These sesamoid bones rarely develop stress fractures, which is often confused with the more common problem of <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/sesamoiditis">sesamoiditis</a></strong></em> in conjunction with a congenital bipartite (split) sesamoid. When sesamoid stress fractures do occur, they usually result from an episode of increased repetitive loading, such as an increase in running distance. Pain under the great toe that is aggravated by standing and walking is common. It is not unusual for patients who suffer a sesamoid stress fracture to have a high arched foot type. X-rays may be diagnostic, although an MRI may be required to clarify the diagnosis. Non-displaced sesamoid stress fractures can be treated non-surgically with 6-8 weeks of limited or no weight-bearing. Displaced or chronic stress fractures may need surgery, which could include fixing the fracture or removing the affected bone.<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />Perhaps the first thing to realize about great toe sesamoid stress fractures is that in many instances, they are not actually stress fractures of one of the two sesamoid bones. Rather, they are a “bipartite sesamoid” with an associated “<em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/sesamoiditis">sesamoiditis</a></strong></em>”. A bipartite sesamoid is a variant of a normal sesamoid, where the bone remains separated into two fragments during development. “<em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/sesamoiditis">Sesamoiditis</a></strong></em>” is a general term that refers to pain under the great toe that occurs from repetitive loading to this area, in a manner that is similar to <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/metatarsalgia/">metatarsalgia</a></strong></em>. Patients with deformities to the great toe in which the sesamoid bones track abnormally, such as a <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/bunions-hallux-valgus/"><em><strong>bunion</strong></em></a>, can also develop a version of sesamoiditis.However, sesamoid stress fractures do occur and also produce chronic pain under the base of the great toe, similar to the symptoms seen in <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/sesamoiditis">sesamoiditis</a></strong></em>. Research shows that sesamoid stress fractures are caused by repetitive loading to this area.  This loading can occur during standing, walking or running, particularly in shoes that do not provide adequate protection. A painful sesamoid stress fracture may cause an individual to limp quite noticeably. Symptoms may settle over time, but they will reoccur if a person resumes repetitive load bearing activities, like running or playing sports.  The pain is often quite localized, and is associated with the involved sesamoid. It’s not uncommon for a sesamoid stress fracture to occur after a hard training run or another type of activity that is associated with more repetitive loading than normal, such as when an individual’s activity level or training level has increased noticeably.<br /><h2>Physical Examination</h2><br />Sesamoid stress fractures are associated with localized tenderness over the involved sesamoid. Movement of the great toe may exacerbate the symptoms. The pain is usually isolated to under the great toe region. It’s not uncommon for these injuries to occur in patients with high arched feet, as this foot shape tends to cause increased loading at the base of the great toe.<br /><h2>Imaging study</h2><br />Routine x-rays of the foot can be very helpful. Typically, they will demonstrate two sections of the sesamoid. What differentiates a stress fracture from the bipartite sesamoid is that the bone fragments of a bipartite sesamoid have a clearly identified margin. This is because the congenital nature of a bipartite sesamoid means that it has been present since development, whereas a sesamoid stress fractures has a fracture-like appearance on radiograph.An MRI can help differentiate a bipartite sesamoid from a sesamoid stress fracture. An MRI may also help differentiate an acute sesamoid fracture from a chronic stress fracture. In addition, it may identify an area of avascular (dead) bone that develops in some sesamoid stress fractures. This happens in some circumstances as the sesamoid bones have a poor blood supply, and a chronic stress fracture or bipartite sesamoid may leave one section of the sesamoid with a limited blood supply.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br /><p align="left">Treatment is more successful when the correct diagnosis is made; specifically, it is critical to determine whether the problem is from a sesamoid stress fracture or a bipartite sesamoid with overlying <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/sesamoiditis">sesamoiditis</a></strong></em>. The general non-operative treatment principles are similar, although a true sesamoid stress fracture will tend to have a worse prognosis.</p><h3>Non-operative treatment</h3><br />Non-operative treatment of a non-displaced acute sesamoid stress fracture requires a period of immobilization and protected weight bearing. The goal is to manage weight bearing through the heel for a period of six to eight weeks, giving the sesamoid bones the best chance to heal properly. Displaced acute stress fractures will need surgical intervention.More commonly, a chronic stress fracture is present and these are managed non-operatively in a manner that is similar to treating <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/sesamoiditis">sesamoiditis</a></strong></em>. Specifically, the area under the base of the great toe is protected. An <em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/foot-and-ankle-medical-supplies/pre-fabricated-over-the-counter-orthotics-insert/"><strong>orthotic</strong> </a></em>that helps to offload this area is used. This is typically an orthotic with a recessed area under the base of the first metatarsal head. This is combined with the cushioned insole and a very stiff sole of the shoe with a slight contour. A <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/non-operative-treatment/comfort-shoes/">stiff sole with a rocker bottom contour</a></strong></em> will allow for a smoother dispersion of the force away from the base of the great toe. In addition, <strong><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/non-operative-treatment/activity-modification/">activity modification</a></em></strong> to help prevent excessive loading to this area should be performed. Time will often help to settle this condition when combined with activity modification.<br /><h3>Surgical treatment</h3><br />The results of surgical treatment are not routinely predictable. The treatment involves repairing the fracture with fixation and removing either portion of or the entire fractured sesamoid bone. Removing the sesamoid bone is performed in conjunction with a repair of the associated joint capsule. One of the issues with both operative and non-operative treatment is that the underlying foot shape (usually high arched) that often contributes to the development of this condition remains unchanged. Therefore, the area under the base toe is constantly and repetitively loaded during standing and walking activities.<br /><h2>Potential complications of surgery</h2><br />There is an array of complications that can occur as a result of sesamoid surgery, including but not limited to:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#infection">Infection</a></strong></em></li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems">Wound healing problems</a></strong></em></li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#pe">Blood clots (DVT and PE)</a></strong></em></li><br /></ul><br />Complications that are <strong>specific</strong> to sesamoid surgery include:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li>Irritation to the nerve running to the inside of the big toe</li><br /> 	<li>Persistence of symptoms as the loading to this area will continue.</li><br /> 	<li>Great toe deformity (<em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/bunions-hallux-valgus/">Bunion</a></em>, hallux varus, cock-up toe)</li><br /></ul><br />If one sesamoid of the great toe is resected without adequate repair or reconstruction of the plantar capsule and flexor halluces brevis muscle, a secondary deformity can develop. Resection of the tibial sesamoid can lead to a bunion deformity. Resection of the lateral sesamoid can lead to Hallux Varus (medial devaiation the tip of the great toe).A Cock-up deformity of the big toe can occur if both sesamoids are resected and the capsule is not adequately repaired. In this instance, the big toe will tend to rise up out of position, creating an uncomfortable deformity.<br /><div><br /><div><br /><div><br /><p align="right">Edited onDecember 7. 2016</p></div><br /></div><br /></div><br />  
<p>Edited by <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/justin-greisberg-md-editor" target="_blank"><em><strong>Justin Greisberg, MD</strong></em></a></p><h2>Summary</h2><br />Lesser metatarsal stress fractures (usually involving the 2nd or 3rd metatarsal bone) are associated with pain in the midfoot to forefoot. They typically occur following prolonged or repetitive walking and are sometimes called “march fractures.” Risk factors for development of a <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/stress-fractures">stress fracture</a> include an increase in activity level, a foot shape that overloads those metatarsals, and/or relatively weak bones (as might be seen with osteoporosis). Treatment involves rest and some degree of immobilization for 4 to 8 weeks. It is always useful to identify any underlying problems that contribute to the injury.<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/stress-fractures">Stress fractures</a> involving the lesser metatarsal bones (typically 2nd or 3rd) will often present with pain and swelling in the midfoot to forefoot. Frequently, there is an increase in activity, as might be seen when a person goes on a trip that requires increased walking, or when an individual is increasing their training in preparation for a marathon. These injuries are sometimes referred to as “march fractures,” since they can be seen in new military recruits who are going on long hikes. On examination, there will be some degree of swelling and tenderness directly over the affected metatarsal. Patients usually can walk on the foot, though there will be a limp.Some foot “shapes” are more at risk for stress fractures. In particular, a foot with a hypermobile first metatarsal, as might be seen in a patient with a large <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/bunions-hallux-valgus">bunion (hallux valgus)</a>, will overload the lesser metatarsals. Similarly, a Morton’s foot, where the first metatarsal is noticeably shorter than the second, may be at risk. In addition, patients with decreased bone density, such as a young woman athlete with irregular menstrual periods (disordered endocrine system), may be at risk as well.<br /><h2>Physical Examination</h2><br />Physical examination will demonstrate localized tenderness at the site of the fracture. There may also be some associated forefoot swelling. The foot type in general may be flat, often with a long second and possibly third toe. There may also be an associated callus under the ball of the foot, at the base of the second or third toe. It is the repetitive absorption of the loading force beyond the capacity of the bone to withstand this force that causes the stress fracture.<br /><h2>Imaging Study</h2><br />Plain x-rays of the foot may demonstrate subtle signs of a stress fracture. However, in acute stress fractures the actual fracture may not be immediately apparent on plain x-rays. The fracture may only be seen on plain x-rays two to three weeks after the injury, as it takes this time for enough new bone (callus) to form in response to the stress fracture.A bone scan or MRI will demonstrate a stress fracture or a stress reaction (pre-stress fracture) earlier, and one of these studies may be indicated if the diagnosis is in question.Metatarsal stress fractures typically occur at the neck region or in the mid-part (shaft) of the bone. Occasionally, high-level ballet and modern dancers will generate stress fractures at the base of the metatarsal, near the midfoot.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br /><h3>Non-Surgical Treatment</h3><br />Most stress fractures can be treated non-surgically. The basic principle is to rest/unload the foot enough to allow more healing than repetitive injury every day. In some patients, activity modification (break from exercise and minimize walking) may be enough. In others, a surgical shoe or cast boot may help. In a rare few, several weeks of crutches may be required. In general, if the patient is feeling better within 2-3 weeks of diagnosis, they are on the right path. It may take a total of 2-3 months for complete recovery, with occasional patients taking even longer.<br /><h3>Surgical Treatment</h3><br />Surgery is rarely indicated for a second or third metatarsal stress fracture. Occasionally, there may be an associated non-union that will need to be treated with surgery. Although it is rare, surgery will usually include fixation with a plate and screws, and possibly a bone graft.<br /><p>Edited on November 14, 2016</p>
<h4>Edited by<a href="http://www.footeducation.com/paul-juliano-md-editor" target="_blank"><em><strong> Paul Juliano, MD</strong></em></a></h4><br /><h2></h2><br /><h2>Summary</h2><br />Posterior Ankle Impingement is characterized by pain behind the ankle joint. Symptoms are exacerbated by pointing the toes in a forced position. Posterior ankle impingement is differentiated from insertional Achilles tendonitis and retrocalcaneal bursitis, in that these conditions are more closely associated with the attachment of the Achilles tendon into the heel bone (calcaneus). Treatment is usually non-surgical, including rest, activity modification, anti-inflammatory medications, and occasionally a corticosteroid injection. If there is a mechanical impingement or a large extra bone behind the ankle (os trigonum), treatment may include removal of the offending bone spur or bone fragment.<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />Pain behind the ankle is the primary symptom of posterior ankle impingement. Symptoms are usually aggravated by pointing the toes (forced plantar flexion). This condition may be precipitated by an acute injury and/or may be associated with an extra bone fragment (os trigonum) at the back of the ankle.<br /><h2>Physical Examination</h2><br />Pain will be localized behind the ankle joint. There may also be some swelling associated. Pointing the toes in a forced position will aggravate symptoms. Sensation and movement is usually normal. Occasionally, the pain will be such that moving the big toe will aggravate symptoms, such as the tendon that runs behind the ankle joint.<br /><h2>Imaging studies</h2><br />Plain x-rays of the foot and ankle from the side may demonstrate an extra fragment of bone extending from the back of the talus (os trigonum). This is quite a common finding on x-ray, although most os trigonums are asymptomatic. Other sources of pain leading to posterior ankle impingement include bone spurs, or evidence of arthritic changes near the ankle or subtalar joint.For many patients with posterior ankle impingement, the x-rays will be normal.A bone scan may be used as a non-specific means of localizing the inflamed and irritated area.An MRI can give more detailed resolution to the bony and soft tissue structures in the region.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br /><h4>Non-Operative Treatment</h4><br />If the condition is not related to a mechanical irritation, such as a loose body or a bone spur, the condition can usually be treated successfully without surgery. Rest and relative immobilization, followed by a period of gradually increasing activity, can be very helpful. Occasionally, a steroid injection into the ankle joint may be beneficial.<br /><h4>Surgical Treatment</h4><br />If a large bone spur, loose body, or symptomatic os trigonum is present and this fails non-operative management, then surgery may be employed to “clean out” this area (debridement). This is often done through an incision on the back outside part of the ankle, but in some instances it may be performed arthroscopically. If a bone spur or os trigonum is removed, then the ankle is usually not destabilized and weight bearing can be commenced immediately after surgery. There is usually persistent swelling and discomfort after the surgery so limiting activities is required until these symptoms settle.<br /><p>Edited on August 8, 2015</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/christopher-w-digiovanni-md-editor/">Edited by Christopher W. DiGiovanni, MD</a></h4><br /><h2>Procedure</h2><br />Endoscopic plantar fasciotomy is used to treat recalcitrant plantar fasciitis that has failed to respond to an appropriate duration of non-operative treatment (at least 6 months).  The surgical procedure involves releasing a portion of the plantar fascia, just beyond its origin as it comes off the heel bone (calcaneus).  This is usually an area where the tissue has abnormally thickened, tightened, calcified, scarred, or even partly torn, and it is this constellation of pathology in whole or in part which likely causes the ongoing pain that brings the patient ultimately to a surgical solution.  Plantar fascial release has been traditionally performed through an open incision, but in some instances, surgeons have more recently elected to perform this release endoscopically, allowing for a smaller incision and potentially faster recovery time.  The operation does not completely disrupt the entire plantar fascia, which is an important structure for arch stability.  Endoscopic release is therefore limited to the pathological area, and is thus preformed through a small incision in the inside of the back part of the foot.  A tube and camera attachment are then advanced into the area for visualization, followed by insertion of a special cutting instrument which is designed to release a select amount of plantar fascia tissue in the area where it meets the heel bone.<br /><h2>Indications</h2><br />Endoscopic partial plantar fasciotomy is an operative procedure that is used to treat chronic (not acute) plantar fasciitis that has failed prolonged nonoperative management.  It should be performed only by a surgeon who has significant experience performing this surgery via an endoscope (small scope that allows for a smaller incision).  Alternatively, the procedure can be performed via traditional open approach with a scalpel, and it should be noted that this is reported to have comparable results.<br /><h2>Potential Complications</h2><br />Potential complications that are specific to a partial plantar fasciectomy relate mostly to its limited exposure and ability to visualize the entire surgical field.  While more limited exposures certainly offer some advantages in terms of having smaller incisions, faster healing, and potentially quicker recovery time, the surgeon’s ability to “see less” while trying to accomplish the same goal can, in rare cases, result in certain specific complications.  These include:<br /><ul><br />	<li><em>Rupture of the plantar fascia</em>.  If an excessive amount of the plantar fascia is inadvertently released, or if the plantar fascia is weak or has tremendous strain across it, it is possible for the remaining plantar fascia to rupture following a limited (open or) endoscopic release.  This can be very painful, and may lead to flattening of the arch.</li><br />	<li><em>Inadequate release of the plantar fascia tissue</em>.  It can sometimes be very difficult to visualize exactly what needs to be cut, and sometimes this can lead to an inadequate fascial release with continued symptoms.  If recognized at the time of surgery, however, it is often best for the surgeon to convert the procedure to an open approach to ensure adequate release has been performed.</li><br />	<li><em>Injury to the associated calcaneal branch of the tibial nerve</em>.  Unintended injury to this very small nerve during the procedure can lead to sensitivity, burning, and increased discomfort.</li><br /></ul><br /><h2>Recovery</h2><br />Recovery is similar to an open plantar facetectomy and may even be slightly quicker.  The tissue needs to be protected for a period of four to six weeks to allow for the area to heal, and to minimize scar formation.  During this time, it may be beneficial to have the foot immobilized, with limited to no weight-bearing and progressive physical therapy exercises, although some surgeons will encourage a more stepwise return to weight-bearing as tolerated if the patient feels comfortable doing so.  Generally speaking, complete recovery from surgery will require a total of 6-12 months, with the primary goal being some relief of pain.<br /><p> Edited on April 17, 2015</p><br />  
Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/stephen-pinney-md-editor-in-chief" target="_blank">Stephen Pinney, MD</a></strong></em><br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />The anterior process of the calcaneus is a prominence on the heel bone (calcaneus) that is located in front and to the outside of the ankle (Figure 1).  Fractures of the anterior process of the calcaneus occur following an acute injury to the foot.  The mechanism is often similar to that of an <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/high-ankle-sprain">ankle sprain</a></strong></em>. The fracture occurs when the calcaneus and cuboid bones that make up the calcaneocuboid joint move strongly against each other, knocking off a rim of the top part (dorsal) of the calcaneus.  The fracture often does not displace significantly.  Patients typically report pain and swelling in front of and to the outside of the ankle.  Although, the injury is quite painful, patients may be able to walk with limp.<br /><h5>Figure 1:  Anterior Process of the Calcaneus</h5><br />^media_display_589c2a12de9125bcb7693281/position:center^<br /><h2>Clinical Examination</h2><br />On examination, there will be tenderness and swelling over the injured area.  The injured area is similar to that of an ankle sprain, although it is located farther from the ankle joint (Figure 2).  The skin and sensation is usually normal, although occasionally this injury can cause the nerve that runs on the outside of the foot (sural nerve) to be irritated, leading to burning or numbness over the outside of the foot.<br /><h5>Figure 2:  Anterior Process Fracture of the Calcaneus:  Location of Injury</h5><br />^media_display_589c2a14de9125bcb7693284/position:center^<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />A fracture of the anterior process of the calcaneus can usually be seen on a plain x-ray lateral view of the foot (Figure 3).  This is a view taken from the side.  However, this injury can often be quite subtle and can easily be missed.  It can be confirmed on a CT or an MRI, which will show the small fracture fragment (Figure 4).<br /><h5>Figure 3:  X-Ray Anterior Process Fracture of the Calcaneus</h5><br />^media_display_589c2a16de9125bcb7693287/position:center^<br /><h5>Figure 4:  MRI Anterior Process Fracture of the Calcaneus</h5><br />^media_display_589c2a18de9125bcb769328a/position:center^<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br /><h3>Non-Operative Treatment</h3><br />Most anterior process fractures of the calcaneus can be treated non-surgically.  If the fracture fragment is not interfering with the function of the calcaneal cuboid joint, non-operative treatment is indicated.  This would consist of relative immobilization in a <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/cam-walker-walking-boot">walker boot</a></strong></em> for typically six weeks, until the soft tissue and fracture have settled.  In some incidences, the fracture will not formally heal which is only problematic if it interferes with the joint function.<br /><h3>Operative Treatment</h3><br />Surgical treatment of anterior calcaneal process fractures are reserved for fractures that interfere with the function of the calcaneal cuboid joint.  For example, if the fracture is in such a position that the bone is irritating the calcaneocuboid joint, then surgical removal of this fragment is indicated.In addition, patients that have residual symptoms following an anterior process fracture of the calcaneus may benefit from surgical removal and cleaning out of the calcaneal cuboid joint.  Recovery from surgery involves protecting the foot until the soft tissues have healed, and then gradually mobilizing the joint.  This can take six weeks or more.<br /><h2>Potential Complications</h2><br />Complications that are specific to the removal of a calcaneal anterior process fracture include:<i><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/sural-neuritis/">Injury to the sural nerve</a> - </i>The sural nerve runs on the outside of the foot and can lead to numbness or a persistent burning sensation in this area.<i>Arthritis of the calcaneal cuboid joint - </i>Arthritis affecting the calcaneocuboid joint can occur, although this is unusual.<i>Persistence of symptoms - </i>The injured area may be persistently loaded, resulting and ongoing pain.<br /><p>Edited on January 17, 2017</p><br />

Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/dave-townshend-md/">Dave Townshend, MD</a></strong></em><br /><h2>Indications</h2><br />A clawtoe deformity that is not pronounced but that does have an associated elevation and extension of the toe, may benefit from a lengthening of the tendon that pulls the toe upwards (Extensor digitorum longus).<br /><h2>Surgical Procedure</h2><br />The surgical procedure involves an incision over the top of the toe. This procedure is actually preformed at the base of the toe, where the tendon runs into the toe. The long tendon that extends the toe is identified. It’s incised in such a way that the tendon is split down the middle, and this allows for the tendon to lengthen. It is then sutured in the newly lengthened position so that the toe can fall down into an improved position. The toe itself is sometimes stabilized with a wire or some means of immobilizing the toe while the tendon heals. Extensor tendon lengthening is often performed in addition to other procedures to correct the toe position (eg PIP fusion, Weils osteotomy)<br /><h2>Recovery</h2><br />Recovery usually requires 6 weeks of immobilization or relative immobilization to allow the tendon to heal. It may be possible to move the toe before then, depending on what other procedures have been done.<br /><h2>Potential Surgical Complications</h2><br /><strong><i>Specific Complications</i></strong>Complications that are relatively specific to a claw toe correction using an extensor tendon lengthening include:<br /><ul><br />	<li><em>Under or over lengthening of tendon. </em>If the tendon is over-lengthened, the toe may fall into a more flexed position. If it’s under-lengthened, an inadequate correction may be obtained.</li><br />	<li><em>Failure of the tendon. </em>If the tendon does not heal, the functioning of the tendon may be limited or absent.</li><br />	<li><em>Increase scarring. </em>There can be significant scarring at the base of the toe that can limit the movement of the tendon, and therefore can limit the function of the toe.</li><br />	<li><em>Vascular injury. </em>Injury to the blood supply to the toe is uncommon.  However, it is possible for the blood vessels supplying the tip of the toe to be injured. If this does occur, necrosis or partial loss of tissue at the tip of the toe may occur.</li><br /></ul><br /><strong><i>General Complications</i></strong>In addition to the specific complications listed above, there is the potential for the following general complications:<br /><ul><br />	<li><em>Infection</em></li><br />	<li><em>Wound healing problems</em></li><br />	<li><em>Nerve injury</em></li><br />	<li><em>Blood clots (Deep Vein Thrombosis / DVT)</em></li><br />	<li><em>Pulmonary embolism</em></li><br /></ul><br /><p>Edited on June 19, 2015 (Originally edited by <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/stephen-pinney-md-editor-in-chief" target="_blank"><strong><em>Stephen Pinney, MD</em></strong></a><strong><em>)</em></strong></p>
Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/stephen-pinney-md-editor-in-chief" target="_blank">Stephen Pinney, MD</a></strong></em><br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />Ingrown toenails may lead to pain and redness, and most commonly invole the big toe. An ingrown toenail may become locally infected with a pus discharge. Symptoms from an ingrown toenail may develop relatively quickly, as the toenails grow into the skin at the edge or at the front of the toenail. It is not uncommon for an ingrown toenail to recur.  Certain toenail shapes, particularly those that are excessively curved into the soft-tissues, will predispose individuals to develop ingrown toenails. In addition, inappropriate cutting of the toenail can also predispose to the development of a painful ingrown toenail.The involved toenail will have associated redness, swelling and occasionally, draining pus. The toenail will often be embedded in the soft tissue. The painful area is usually on one side of the toenail, although it is not uncommon for both sides to be involved. In addition, occasionally multiple toes can be afflicted with ingrown toenails.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br />Ingrown toenails are treated by reducing the soft-tissue swelling, addressing any local infection, controlling the pain, and appropriate trimming of the nails in order to minimize the chance of a recurrence.<br /><h3><em>Reducing the swelling</em></h3><br />Soaking the toe in warm salt (saline) water can help kill the local bacteria and soften up the inflamed soft-tissue.  Ten-minute soaks, 2-3 times per day, may result in less tissue swelling and therefore an improvement in symptoms.<br /><h3><em>Addressing any local infection</em></h3><br />In most instances, the local infection will clear up when the inflamed soft-tissue has settled.  Warm salt-water soaks can be helpful.  On rare occasions, antibiotics may need to be prescribed to control the infection.<br /><h3><em>Controlling the Pain</em></h3><br />Comfort shoes with a wide toe box are important in the treatment of an acute ingrown toenail.  Repetitive bumping up against a tight shoe will be painful and may worsen the condition.  Acetaminophen or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication may also be used to help control the symptoms of pain in the short term.<br /><h3><i>Appropriate Trimming of the Toenail</i></h3><br />Cutting the toenail straight across is a key component of successfully treating ingrown toenails.  Excessively cutting the edges of the toenail may provide some initial relief but may worsen the problem as the toenail grows back.<br /><h2>Surgical Treatment</h2><br />Fortunately, most ingrown toenails can be treated without surgery.  However, for abnormally shaped toenails and others sources of painful recurrent ingrown toenails that can not be controlled with normal non-operative treatment, surgery may be indicated. Surgery may include:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><i>Removal of part of the toenail. </i>Removing the side of the nail that is growing into the inflamed soft-tissue will clear the symptoms.  However, as the nail grows back (~2mm/month), the ingrown toe nail may recur.</li><br /> 	<li><i>Removing the entire toenail. </i>For ingrown toenails involving the lesser toes (toes 2-5), or when there is tissue overgrowth on both sides of the toenail of the big toe, a removal of the entire toenail is indicated.  This will usually clear the symptoms, although recurrence of the ingrown toenail can occur as the toenail grows back.</li><br /> 	<li><i>Removal of the toenail and removal (ablation) of the nail bed matrix. </i>Ablation of the nail matrix may be necessary for ingrown toenails that have an unusual shape, and are therefore at a high risk for recurrence, or if previous toenail removal has not successfully treated the condition.  In this procedure, the toenail is removed and then the nail bed treated so that the nail will not grow back.  This nail bed ablation can be done by surgically removing the nail or by treating it with a chemical such as Phenol that kills (cauterizes) the cells in the nail bed from which the toenail grows.  In some instances, not all of the cells will be killed or removed and recurrence of spikes of nail may recur.</li><br /></ul><br /> <br /><p align="right">Edited on November 22, 2016</p>

It is often associated with tightening and scarring of the joint capsule at the base of the toe. The toe will tend to extend upwards and over time, the tissue that makes up the top part of this joint lining (joint capsule) can become thickened and scarred.  When this happens even if the toe is brought down into a more normal position, the claw toe can recur because of this scarred capsule. Therefore a formal release of this scarred capsule may be needed in order to aid the correction.An MTP joint capsule release is typically used in more mild to moderate claw toe deformities that have a contracture of the joint capsule at the base of the toe.<br /><h2>Contraindications</h2><br />Patients with multiple foot problems in addition to the hammertoe should avoid surgery for just the hammertoe alone.  Other reasons to avoid surgery include active infection, poor circulation to the toes, and any serious illness that would make surgery unsafe.<br /><h2>Procedure</h2><br />An incision is made over the top (dorsal) aspect of the foot at the base of the clawtoe. This incision may also be used to perform additional procedures that may be needed to correct the claw toe. Next, the top aspect of the toe joint (metatarsal phalangeal (MTP) joint) is exposed. The thickened top part of the joint capsule is then cut (released). The joint capsule, both on the inside (medial) and the outside (lateral) are also often released to allow the toe to fall into an improved position. It may be necessary to stabilize the toe with a pin across the joint. This would be particularly necessary if the joint had been partially out of position prior to the surgery. This will often occur in patients with severe clawtoe deformities.<br /><h2>Recovery</h2><br />Recovery from the surgery is often dictated by the associated procedures that were required to correct the clawtoe. The actual recovery from this surgery is relatively quick and movement can be started once the incision has healed, after 10-14 days. If a pin was used, it is typically removed at 4-6 weeks after surgery, and motion exercises are started after the pin is removed. There are often other procedures such as a PIP joint fusion or a tendon procedure that will limit mobility of the toe for the first 6 weeks.<br /><h2>Potential Surgical Complications:</h2><br /><strong>Specific Complications</strong>Complications that are specific to a MTP capsule release procedure are uncommon, but may include:<br /><ul><br />	<li>Stiffness</li><br />	<li>Scarring at the base of the toe can lead to stiffness.</li><br />	<li>Recurrence of the Deformity</li><br /></ul><br />If new scarring of the joint capsule occurs, the deformity can occur.<strong>General Complications</strong>In addition to the specific complications listed above there is the potential for the following general complications:<br /><ul><br />	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications">Infection</a></li><br />	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications">Wound healing problems</a></li><br />	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications">Nerve injury</a></li><br />	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications">Blood clots (Deep Vein Thrombosis / DVT) –uncommon in toe surgery</a></li><br />	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications">Pulmonary embolism –uncommon in toe surgery</a></li><br /></ul><br /><p align="center">Edited on December 2, 2015</p>

Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/stephen-pinney-md-editor-in-chief" target="_blank">Stephen Pinney, MD</a></strong></em><br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />Patients with compartment syndrome of the foot report intense pain and swelling. This condition is uncommon, but when it occurs it is usually associated with a major injury to the foot, such as a fracture of the heel (calcaneal fracture) or a major midfoot fracture. When there is significant swelling in the muscles of the foot, this swelling may be restricted by the tense fibrous tissue (fascia) that surrounds each “compartment” of muscles. As a result, the muscles lose oxygenation from lack of blood supply.  Intense pain and eventually muscle death can occur. There are nine compartments to the foot. Each contains a group of muscles. When compartment syndrome of the foot does occur, it is common for many, or all, of these compartments to be involved.<br /><h2>Physical Exam</h2><br />On examination, the foot will usually be markedly swollen and the muscles tense. An associated traumatic injury to the foot is usually present. In severe cases, there may also be a decrease in sensation to the toes. Movement of the toes will create significant pain in the foot for conscious patients.<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />X-rays will demonstrate the associated underlying foot injury, but will not be able to specifically diagnose the compartment syndrome.Compartment pressure monitoring can be used to diagnose compartment syndrome. Pressure monitoring that demonstrates pressures within the compartment that are less than 20-25 mm of mercury less than the lowest aspect of the blood pressure (diastolic pressure) is suggestive of compartment syndrome.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br />Treatment for compartment syndrome is controversial. The muscles of the foot are small. It is always difficult to know the extent to which they are involved. If compartment syndrome does result in muscle death over time, the resulting sequelae will be significant <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/claw-toes/">clawing of the lesser toes</a>, pain, and dysfunction in the foot.If compartment syndrome is diagnosed, surgical release is often indicated. This involves opening up the various compartments of the foot through a series of 3 or 4 incisions (2 on the top, 1 on the side as necessary) to release the swollen compartments. Releasing the strong fibrous tissue that makes up the muscle compartments will allow blood to flow to the compartment.  This will preserve the muscle tissue, provided the compartments are released in a timely manner.  However, it is relatively common for compartment syndrome of the foot to develop without being identified.  If this does occur, then over time the toes will become clawed and in severe cases the foot may be dysfunctional if widespread death of the muscles of the foot has occurred.<br /><p>Edited January 11, 2017</p>
Edited by <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/robert-leland-md-editor/"><em><strong>Robert Leland, MD</strong></em></a><br /><h2>Indication</h2><br />The PIP is the first joint of the small toes. The indication for surgery is when this joint has a fixed curved (<strong><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/claw-toes">Clawtoe or Hammer Toe</a></em></strong>) deformity. The deformity and is producing enough pain or functional limitations to warrant surgery. The deformity develops gradually and cannot be straightened because it is bent and fixed in this position for a long period of time.The procedure essentially straightens the joint and fuses the proximal and middle phalanx (toe bones) in the straightened position.<br /><h2>Operative Procedure</h2><br />There are a variety of ways that a PIP joint fusion can be preformed. The joint can be approached either through a longitudinal or transverse incision on the top of the toe. Once the joint is opened up, a small segment of bone is removed from either side of the joint, which creates enough room for the joint to straighten.  The joint is then fixed in the straightened position, either with a wire or occasionally with an internal screw. This procedure is usually done in association with other procedures, such as a tendon transfer, to help keep the toe in the newly straightened position (ex.<em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/surgical-procedures/flexor-to-extensor-transfer-for-clawtoe-deformity-correction-girdlestone-taylor-procedure/"> Girdlestone-Taylor procedure</a></strong></em>, <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/extensor-tendon-lengthening-for-clawtoe-correction">Extensor Tendon Lengthening</a></strong></em> ). Additional procedures to address underlying mechanical problems such as a gastrocnemius contracture or hypermobile first ray, which may have caused the small toe deformities, may be corrected in addition to the PIP joint fusion.<br /><h2>Recovery</h2><br />Recovery from this surgery needs to take into consideration any other operative procedures that were done in conjunction with this surgery. Recovery from a PIP joint fusion typically takes about 6 weeks, although the toe can remain swollen for much longer. During this time, it is usually necessary to keep the joint immobilized in the new position. It’s sometimes possible to have the patient weight bear through the heel during this period. If a wire (pin) is used to maintain the toe in a straightened position, it will be removed between 2 and 6 weeks post-surgery.<br /><h2>Potential Complications</h2><br /><strong>Specific complications</strong> of PIP joint fusion surgery include:<br /><ul><br />	<li><em>Infection around the wire penetration site</em>. If a wire is used to maintain the position, keeping the tip of the toe clean is very important until the pin is removed. This normally needs to stay clean, dry, and protected from possible trauma.</li><br />	<li><i>Stiffness and rigidity of the toe</i>. This comes not just from the toe being fuse, but also from the increased blood flow to the area, which can cause increased tissue swelling. Generally, a straight stiff toe is more functional than a bent stiff toe which is present prior to surgery.</li><br />	<li><i>Swelling of the toe</i>. The toe can remain swollen for many months.</li><br />	<li><i>Malposition</i>. It is not uncommon for the joint to be fused in a slightly off-centered position, which in some instances can be problematic.</li><br />	<li><i>Blood Vessel (Vascular) Injury</i>. There are two small blood vessels that run on either side of the toe. If these are injured, the blood flow to the tip of the toe may be lost.  This can result in necrosis of the tip of the toe.  Although rare, this may lead to a partial amputation of the toe.</li><br />	<li><i>Residual pain</i>:  As the toe is a relatively confined space, it’s not uncommon to have swelling and residual pain for an extended period of time.</li><br />	<li><em>Toe Shortening</em>: By removing a small piece of bone prior to fusion, the toe will be slightly shortened.</li><br /></ul><br />In addition, there is the usual array of potential <strong>general complications</strong>, including:<br /><ul><br />	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#infection"><i>Infection</i></a></strong></li><br />	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems"><i>Wound healing problems</i></a></strong></li><br />	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#nerve-injury"><i>Nerve injuries</i></a></strong></li><br />	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#dvt"><i>Blood clots</i></a></strong></li><br />	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#pe"><i>Pulmonary embolism (PE)</i> </a></strong>:  Although much less likely for toe surgery, blood clots and PE’s can still occur.</li><br /></ul><br /> <br /><p align="right">Edited on December 20, 2015 (originally edited by <strong><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/hussein-pazkad-md/" target="_blank">Hossein Pakzad, MD</a></em></strong>)</p><br /> 
Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/dave-townshend-md/" target="_blank">Dave Townshend, MD</a></strong></em><br /><h2>Summary</h2><br />Sinus tarsi syndrome is characterized by acute, localized pain in the outside front part of the ankle (sinus tarsi). Physical examination will localize pain and swelling to this area (Figure 1). Symptoms are often exacerbated by standing and walking, and there may be an associated flatfoot deformity. Treatment is oriented towards modifying<em><strong> <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/activity-modification">activities</a></strong></em>, wearing a <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/comfort-shoes">comfortable shoe</a></strong></em>, trying a <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-lacers">brace</a></strong></em>, and possibly getting a <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/corticosteroid-injections"><strong><em>local injection of</em> <em>corticosteroids</em></strong></a>. All of these treatments are designed to improve symptoms. Occasionally, surgery may be contemplated for a recalcitrant sinus tarsi syndrome.  However if surgery is considered, it needs to address the specific cause of sinus tarsi syndrome.<br /><h5>Figure 1:  Classic Location of sinus tarsi pain</h5><br />^media_display_589c2a22de9125bcb76932a3/position:center^<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />Patients with sinus tarsi syndrome present with pain in the front and outside of the ankle (anterolateral ankle). Symptoms are often aggravated by standing or walking. Pain may be quite localized.  The pain can develop slowly over time, or it may be precipitated by a period of increased activity. It is important to rule out other more specific causes of pain in this area of the ankle (<em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/peroneal-tendonitis">peroneal tendinitis</a></strong></em>, <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/anterior-process-fracture-of-the-calcaneus">anterior process fracture of the calcaneus</a></strong></em>, <em>ECT</em>.)<br /><h2>Physical Examination</h2><br />Physical examination will identify localized pain just in front of and below the prominent bone (fibula) on the outside of the ankle (Figure 2). There may be associated swelling in this area. Rotating the foot to the outside may reproduce symptoms. A flatfoot may be a prominent feature of this condition.<br /><h5>Figure 2:  Classic location of sinus tarsi pain on physical exam</h5><br />^media_display_589c2a24de9125bcb76932a6/position:center^<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />X-rays may show some impingement in the sinus tarsi area. This can show up as an increased density of bone right in the impingement on the calcaneus. X-rays are also helpful to rule out other causes of pain in the anterolateral aspect of the ankle (ex. <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/anterior-process-fracture-of-the-calcaneus"><em><strong>calcaneal process fracture</strong></em></a>).<br /><p align="left">An MRI often shows evidence of increased blood flow (edema) in the involved bones (calcaneus, talus and fibula).  An MRI may also show fluid and inflammation associated with the sinus tarsi, where the outside lower (anterior and posterior) aspect of the talus impinges on the heel bone (calcaneus) in the sinus tarsi.</p><h2>Treatment</h2><br /><h3>Non-Operative Treatment</h3><br />Treatment is usually non-operative. It consists of:1)    <strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/activity-modification"><i>Activity modification</i></a></strong>:  Avoiding activities that precipitate symptoms.2)   <strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/comfort-shoes"><i>Comfort Shoewear</i></a></strong>:  Symptoms can be improved with the use of comfortable shoes consisting of a shock absorbing heel, a relatively stiff sole, and a rocker contour to help disperse the force more evenly up the leg.3)   <strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-lacers"><i>Ankle Lacer</i></a></strong>:  An ankle brace may be helpful to limit and minimize symptoms.4)    <strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory-drugs-nsaids"><i>Anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs</i></a><i>)</i></strong>:  Pain and swelling may be improved with the use of anti-inflammatory medications, provided there is no contra-indications to taking this type of medication.5)    <strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/corticosteroid-injections"><i>Corticosteroid injection</i></a></strong> :  A local injection of corticosteroids may help settle symptoms in this area.<br /><h3>Operative Treatment</h3><br />Surgical treatment may be considered for patients that have truly failed non-operative treatment. However, it needs to be contemplated with care as sinus tarsi syndrome is often a final manifestation of another more integrated problem, such as <strong><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/acquired-adult-flatfoot-deformity-posterior-tibial-tendon-dysfunction">adult acquired flatfoot</a></em></strong> syndrome. In the setting of a <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/characteristics-of-flat-foot">flatfoot</a></strong></em> , the foot essentially slides off of the lower bone of the ankle and impinges on the outside. Therefore, sinus tarsi syndrome in this setting requires not just a cleaning out of the sinus tarsi (debridement), but perhaps a reconstruction of the foot.Traditional sinus tarsi surgery might involve a debridement of bone spurs in this area. <br /><p align="right">Edited on November 9, 2016</p>
Edited by <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/michael-shereff-md-editor/"><em><strong>Michael Shereff, MD</strong></em></a><br /><h2>Summary</h2><br />A subluxing peroneal tendon creates pain, as one of the rope-like peroneal tendons pops in and out (subluxes) of the groove in the bone on the outside of the ankle (fibula). This condition often occurs chronically, but <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/peroneal-tendon-subluxation-acute">acute peroneal tendon subluxation</a></strong></em> may also occur following a precipitating injury.  Treatment of chronic peroneal tendon subluxation involves avoiding precipitating activities, and possibly <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-taping">taping the ankle</a></strong></em> to minimize tendon subluxation.  Operative treatment is reserved for chronic peroneal subluxation that cannot be addressed non-operatively, and that consists of repairing the torn fibrous tissue (retinaculum) that would normally keep the tendon in place.<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />Patients with chronic peroneal tendon subluxation will complain of pain, along with a sensation of a moving or snapping tendon on the outside of their ankle.  They will note that when their foot is in certain positions, they will feel a sensation of one of the peroneal tendons (peroneus brevis) moving behind their ankle, and this will often be associated with a sharp pain.  Subluxation of the peroneal tendons will usually occur when the heel is pointed to the outside, or perhaps when the foot is loaded and the patient is rotating over top of it.  In some cases, the peroneal tendon can be flipped in an out of its groove behind the fibula at the will of the patient -- essentially the tendon is rolled back and forth over the bone on the outside of the ankle.  Patients will often give a history of a previous <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/peroneal-tendon-subluxation-acute/"><em><strong>acute peroneal tendon subluxation</strong></em></a> or injuries to this area, although some chronic peroneal tendon subluxations can occur spontaneously if the restraining tissues get gradually stretched out.<br /><h2>Physical Examination</h2><br />Patients with chronic peroneal tendon subluxation will often have tenderness located behind the bone on the outside of the ankle.  In addition, with the back part of the foot pointed to the outside (everted), the tendons will often be able to move out of position and this demonstration clinically of the subluxation of the tendons confirms the diagnosis. The pain is usually quite localized. It’s not uncommon for patients to have a <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/characteristics-of-high-arched-foot-subtle-cavus">higher arched foot</a></strong></em>, as this foot shape predisposes to increased tension through the peroneal tendons.<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />Plain x-rays of the hindfoot will often be normal.  Occasionally, a small rim of bone associated with the back part (posterior) of the fibula will be noted that is consistent with a previous old avulsion injury, whereby the superior peroneal retinaculum pulls off a small fragment of bone (fibula).An MRI will often show a disruption of the superior peroneal retinaculum.  In addition, an MRI or a CT scan can be used to assess the shape of the back part of the fibula.  The reason this is important is that normally this shape should be concave, essentially creating a cavity in which the tendons run.  In some patients, the shape of the bone is flat or even convex, and this will predispose to subluxation of the peroneal tendon.Ultrasound may be used to visualize what the subluxing tendon is doing dynamically. It can help identify the shape of the fibula, and assess the extent of damage to the peroneal retinaculum.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br /><h3>Non-Operative treatment</h3><br />Chronic peroneal tendon subluxation can often be successfully treated non-operatively.  If the subluxation events occur relatively infrequently, and only with certain sporting activities, then <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-taping">taping</a></strong></em> or immobilizing the ankle with an <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-lacers">ankle lacer</a> </strong></em>can be helpful to minimize the chance of a recurrent subluxation episode.<br /><h3>Operative Treatment</h3><br />Surgical treatment is indicated if the subluxation is regular and significantly impacts the patient's lifestyle.  The type of surgery is dictated by the pathology that is identified on clinical exam and imaging studies.  The goal of surgery is to keep the tendons contained within the canal behind the fibula.  Part of the surgical reconstruction involves repairing the superior peroneal retinaculum back to bone, so that there is no longer a sleeve of retinaculum that the tendons can roll under.  In addition, in some patients a bony procedure is required in order to deepen the back part of the fibula to create an appropriate cavity for the tendons to run in.<br /><h2>Recovery</h2><br />Recovery from surgery requires a moderately long period, usually in the order of six weeks of immobilization, in order to allow the retinaculum and any bony procedures to heal.  This is followed by four to six weeks of fairly graduated and intensive rehabilitation.  It is often six months or more before the patient has reached a lot of their improvement following the surgery.<br /><h2>Potential Complications</h2><br />Complications that are specific to a repair of the superior peroneal retinaculum include:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><i>Recurrence of the peroneal tendon subluxation. </i>The surgical repair can stretch out or be reinjured, leading to recurrence of the peroneal tendon subluxation.</li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#nerve-injury"><i>Nerve injury.</i></a></strong> The <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/sural-neuritis/">sural nerve</a></strong></em> maybe injured.  This nerve supplies the sensation to the outside of the foot.

Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/lance-silverman-md-editor">Lance Silverman, MD</a></strong></em><br /><h2>Summary</h2><br />Sural neuritis (a.k.a. sural neuralgia) is pain that comes from irritation or injury to the sural nerve.  The pain is typically a burning sensation, and located on the outside of the ankle and foot. It may occur following surgery in this area or after a direct blow over the sural nerve.  In many instances, the condition will improve over time.  Specific treatment includes aggressive massage to the nerve to help desensitize it, as well as avoiding direct pressure over the nerve. Occasionally, surgery to release the scar around the nerve is required, while in other circumstances, excision of the nerve is indicated.<br /><h2>Clinical Presentations</h2><br />The sural nerve runs down the back of the leg, behind the outside edge (lateral) of the ankle, and along the outside of the foot.  The nerve provides sensation to all those areas and the 4th and 5th toes.  The nerve can develop neuritis as a result of an injury, irritation, or inflammation.  Sural Neuritis leads to pain on the outside of the hindfoot that is often burning in nature. Symptoms can be aggravated by direct pressure.  The involved area is often hypersensitive to touch. A stretching injury to the nerve, such as that which may occur in an<em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/sprained-ankle"> ankle sprain</a></strong></em>, is a common cause of sural neuritis. This commonly resolves with time. During surgery, the course of this nerve is variable, and therefore although uncommon it may be injured during standard surgical approaches.  Retractors used to aid in the exposure of the surgical incision may inadvertently stretch the nerve, and bleeding and bruising following surgery may cause excessive scarring around the nerve. Sometimes, simply the swelling for surgery or injury in the area disturbs the function of the nerve, and symptoms can develop. Any of these mechanisms can lead to the development of sural neuritis with resulting pain and/or irritation at the site of injury, and with altered sensation or numbness from that location down the remaining course of the nerve.<br /><h2>Physical Examination</h2><br />Physical examination is the key to diagnosis. Tapping (known as percussion or Tinel’s sign) creates an electrical like sensation that is most exaggerated at the site of nerve injury. There may be a localized area of tenderness at the site of nerve injury. In some instances, there may be skin color changes where the skin blanches with direct touch.<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />Plain x-rays are rarely helpful in the diagnosis of sural neuritis. The nerve is a soft tissue structure and does not show up on x-rays. MRI is also unlikely to be helpful as the nerve is too small to visualize. However, these imaging studies may give some indication of previous surgery or injury to the area.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br />Treatment of sural neuritis is aimed at addressing the underlying nerve injury or scarring. In most instances, this can be treated successfully non-operatively.<br /><h3>Non-operative Treatment</h3><br />There are a variety of non-operative treatments that may be helpful including:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><i>Desensitization. </i>Direct massage to the area, although initially uncomfortable can over time help to desensitize this area. This is designed to break up the scar tissue and get the nerve used to being moved.</li><br /> 	<li><i>Medication. </i>In some instances, medications like Gabapentin (Neurontin), or Pregabalin (Lyrica) may help stabilize the irritated nerve.</li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/corticosteroid-injections"><i>Corticosteroid injection</i></a></strong>. On occasion, a localized corticosteroid injection may help break up the scar tissue and improve pain.</li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/comfort-shoes"><i>Comfort shoe wear</i></a>. </strong>Avoiding direct pressure over the area, or applying padding over the area may improve symptoms.</li><br /></ul><br /><h3>Operative Treatment</h3><br />Most cases of sural neuritis will resolve with non-surgical measures.  However, if there is a specific scarring of the nerve or if there is irritation from hardware that does not respond to non-operative treatment, surgery may be indicated.  Surgical treatment usually involves either:<i>Releasing (freeing up) the nerve. </i>Surgery to free up the nerve form scar tissue and remove any irritating structures (ex. <strong><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/painful-hardware/">retained hardware</a></em></strong>) may be helpful.  However, scar tissue will have a tendency to recur, and nerve wrapping with collagen may prevent this scar.<i>Nerve resection. </i>If the sural nerve is too damaged from previous scarring, and symptoms are bad enough, it is often best to remove the nerve and bury a healthy end of muscle in the middle of the leg. Since the sural nerve provides only sensation to the outside of the ankle and foot, and has no muscle innervation, the results from nerve excision cause only numbness without loss of motor function.<br /><h2>Potential Complications</h2><br />One of the potential concerns of sural neuritis is the potential for this to expand into a <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#crps">complex regional pain syndrome</a></strong></em> that, although unlikely, can be a debilitating condition. <br /><p align="right">Edited on December 21, 2016</p>

It is often aggravated by constrictive footwear. The underlying problem is a prominent bone spur that may form in response to arthritis in one of the midfoot joints.  Treatment is usually non-operative, aimed at avoiding pressure overlying the prominent bone. Taking care to ensure that the tongue of the shoe is not tied tightly and that there is an associated soft padding over the boney prominence can greatly improve symptoms. In addition, stiff soled shoes can be helpful with respect to symptoms. Occasionally, surgical removal of the bone spur or even fusion of the underlying arthritic bone joint may be necessary.<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />A painful lump on the top of the foot is the main symptom of a tarsal boss. The lump is usually located over the mid part of the foot. It may create pain with constrictive footwear. It may also be associated with an aching pain in the mid foot, as there is a correlation between the presence of a prominent tarsal boss and <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/midfoot-arthritis/">midfoot arthritis</a>.<br /><h2>Physical Examination</h2><br />An examination will demonstrate a lump on the top (dorsal aspect) of the midfoot. This lump is often hard from the underlying bone. This differentiates a tarsal boss from a <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/ganglion-cysts/">ganglion</a>, which is a lump that is softer due to the fluid-filled sac that causes it.<br /><h2>Imaging</h2><br />Plain x-rays of the foot will usually reveal a bone spur in the top part of the midfoot. (Figure 1)<br /><h5>Figure 1: Foot X-Ray showing Tarsal Boss (midfoot Bone Spur)</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Figure-1-Foot-X-Ray-showing-Tarsal-Boss-midfoot-Bone-Spur-copy.png">^media_display_589c2a26de9125bcb76932ad/position:center^</a>This is usually associated with the tarsal-metatarsal joint. There may also be some wear and tear arthritis of this joint (<a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/midfoot-arthritis/">midfoot arthritis</a>), which leads to the bone spur. Essentially, the bone spur creates the prominence, which leads to the localized discomfort from the constrictive shoe.<br /><h2><b>Treatment</b></h2><br /><h3>Non-operative Treatment</h3><br />Most tarsal boss presentations can be treated non-operatively.  Creating a soft area in the shoe, and not tying shoes quite as tightly over this area will often lead to resolution of these symptoms, although the prominence on the top of the foot will not be fully resolved. In addition, shoes with an associated stiff sole can be helpful as this will put less force through the mid part of the foot.<br /><h3>Surgical Treatment</h3><br />Occasionally the prominence of the bone spur or of the associated pain from the underlying midfoot arthritis of the tarsal-metatarsal joint will necessitate surgical intervention. In this instance, there are two surgical procedures that can be performed:<br /><ol><br /> 	<li><i>Removal of the prominent dorsal bone spur</i>. A fairly straight forward operation can be performed to identify the bone spur and remove it. This is associated with a relatively quick recovery time. However, usually the underlying reason why the bone spur occurred (wear and tear in the tarsal-metatarsal joint) is not addressed.  And therefore, there is a higher likelihood that the bone spur will reoccur over time.</li><br /> 	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/surgical-procedures/midfoot-fusion/"><i>Fusion of the midfoot joints</i></a>. If the bone spur is a product of significant midfoot arthritis, which is also symptomatic, a fusion of this joint (midfoot arthrodesis) may be beneficial. This involves preparing the joint, fixating it with screws or a plate, and keeping off the foot for a 6-8 week period, until adequate fusion has occurred. This type of surgery is much more involved than a simple removal of the bone spur, and may be associated with the typical complications that can occur with fusion surgery.</li><br /></ol><br /> <br /><p align="right">Edited November 30, 2016</p><br /> 
Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/michael-salamon-md-editor/">Michael Salamon, MD</a></strong></em>Tibialis Anterior Tendonitis leads to pain and often swelling in the front of the ankle and into the midfoot. Sometimes the tendon may have degeneration within it as well, and not just inflammation. Symptoms typically occur in middle aged and older individuals. Symptoms are aggravated by standing and walking. Treatment is designed to limit the loading through the tendon and allow the tendon inflammation to settle. Occasionally, tibialis anterior tendonitis will be a precursor to a rupture of the anterior tibial tendon. Except in the instance of tendon rupture, surgery is usually not necessary. However, for individuals that have truly failed non-operative management, surgery to clean out the tendon and possibly <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/surgical-procedures/gastrocnemius-slide-strayer-procedure/">lengthen the calf muscle</a> may be indicated.<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />Tibialis Anterior Tendonitis is an irritation and swelling of one of the main tendons that lifts the foot up –the <em>anterior tibial tendon</em> which is also known as the <em>tibialis anterior</em>.  This condition leads to pain in the front of the ankle or the medial midfoot where it inserts on the bone(Figure 1). It is often chronic and may also be associated with some swelling in this area. Symptoms tend to occur in patients that are middle aged or older. Symptoms may be aggravated by increased activity, such as standing and walking.In a small percentage of patients, anterior tibialis tendonitis will be a precursor to anterior tibial tendon rupture. This will be associated with a sharp pain in the front of the ankle often extending into the inside of the mid-foot. Weakness in the ability to bring the foot upward will be noted. Over time, if a rupture of the anterior tibial tendon is missed and not treated there may be increased clawing of the toes, as the tendons to the toes will now be doing most of the work in elevating the foot. Patients may also complain of the foot slapping on the ground when they walk.<br /><h5>Figure 1: Location of Pain and Swelling in Anterior Tibial Tendonitis</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Anterior-Tibial-Tendonitis-Pin-Location-Figure-1.png">^media_display_589c2a2cde9125bcb76932b1/position:center^</a><br /><h2>Physical Examination</h2><br />Examination will often reveal tenderness or even swelling over the anterior tibial tendon in front of the ankle. This is one of the primary tendons that lifts the foot upwards, therefore, resistance to moving the foot upwards (dorsiflexion) will often exacerbate symptoms. There may be a tightness of the calf muscle (<a href="http://www.footeducation.com/equinus-contractures">equinus contracture</a>).<br /><h2>Imaging Studies<i><br /></i></h2><br />Plain x-rays of the foot and ankle are often negative as this is a problem involving a tendon (soft tissue) that will not usually be seen on plain x-rays.An MRI of this area will reveal swelling and inflammation of the lining of the tendon sheath that the anterior tibial tendon runs through. There will often be fluid around this tendon, and there may be signs of degenerative change within the tendon itself.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br />Treatment for this condition is initially non-operative and is usually successful in settling the symptoms. The treatment involves relative rest of the irritated tendon. This can be done by:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em>Limiting activities</em>. This will limit the repetitive load through the tendon.  This may be accomplished by limiting standing and walking or any other activities that cause the ankle joint to be repetitively moved.  For severe symptoms it may be beneficial to formally place the patient in a <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/cam-walker-walking-boot?wpmp_switcher=mobile">walker boot</a> or cast for a period of a few weeks.</li><br /> 	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory-drugs-nsaids"><em>Anti-inflammatory medications</em></a>. This can be helpful to settle symptoms if anti-inflammatories can be tolerated.</li><br /> 	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/calf-stretch"><em>Calf Stretching</em></a>. By stretching the calf, there will be less resistance to elevating (dorsiflexion) the foot. This puts less force through the tendon.</li><br /> 	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-lacers"><em>Ankle-Lacer </em></a><em>or (</em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-foot-orthosis-afo"><em>AFO</em></a>). A brace to stabilize the ankle or to limit the movement through the ankle can help to decrease the load through this tendon, therefore help the symptoms.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Rehabilitation</em>. Eccentric strengthening programs may be helpful in treating the more chronic symptoms.</li><br /></ul><br />Caution: Corticosteroid injections in this region may help settle the symptoms but may increase the risk of rupture of this tendon.<br /><h3>Operative Treatment</h3><br />In instances where the symptoms cannot be managed adequately through non-operative management, surgery may be an option. Surgery consists of cleaning out the tendon (debriding) as well as, possibly <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/gastrocnemius-slide-strayer-procedure">lengthening out the calf muscle.</a><br /><h2>Potential Complications</h2><br />Potential complications include the general complications that may be associated with surgery such as:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#infection"><i>Infection</i></a></strong></li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems"><i>Wound healing problems</i></a></strong></li><br /> 	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#dvt"><strong><i>Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT</i>)</strong></a></li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#pe"><i>Pulmonary embolism</i></a></strong></li><br /> 	<li><i>Persistence of symptoms</i></li><br /></ul><br /> <br /><p align="right">Edited on November 2, 2016 (Originally edited by <strong><em><u><span style="color: #0066cc;">Hossein Pakzad MD</span></u></em></strong>)</p><div></div>
Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/christopher-w-digiovanni-md-editor" target="_blank">Chris DiGiovanni, MD</a></strong></em><br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />Patients with rheumatoid arthritis of the hindfoot will often present with swelling, pain, and deformity that localizes to the ankle and hindfoot region.  Although such symptoms can be the first signs of <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/rheumatoid-arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</a></strong></em>, these patients have usually already been diagnosed with this malady before seeking the care of the orthopaedic foot and ankle specialist.  Since rheumatoid disease typically has a significant inflammatory component associated with it, however, any patient who presents with focal bogginess and pain along the hindfoot should be considered for a rheumatological problem if alternative diagnoses (post-traumatic arthritis, osteoarthritis, septic arthritis, etc) seem unlikely.  Patients often cannot discern between a problem affecting their hindfoot or their ankle, but in both cases they are likely to point to the lateral or posterior portions of the back of their ankle and hindfoot.These symptoms are frequently magnified after prolonged standing or walking, and involvement of the other side (i.e., symmetrical arthritis) is not uncommon.  In more progressed cases, deformity of the ankle and/or hindfoot can exist, which usually results in a valgus malalignment.  To the patient, this can look like the foot/heel is splaying outward, the foot is turning, and/or the leg is rotating.  When the problem becomes severe enough, this valgus malposition can cause subfibular abutment, whereby the foot externally rotates and abducts so far outwardly that it hits the side of the ankle during stance.  This is very painful and can be a common cause for presentation to the foot and ankle specialist.<br /><h2>Physical Examination</h2><br />Careful physical examination is an important part of this work-up for the patient, and often demonstrates swelling of the ankle and/or back part of the foot (hindfoot), associated warmth of the skin from the increased blood flow, soft tissue bogginess, and possibly even a superficial skin rash, nail changes, and hard nodules or lumps in the skin called rheumatoid nodules.  These patients will also commonly demonstrate a noticeable limp and a shortened stride length because of their relative pain and deformity.  In all cases, the opposite extremity should be examined for similar involvement, as should the joints both above and below these areas (knee/ankle, mid/forefoot).<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />When advanced rheumatoid disease is present at a level which causes the patient to seek the care of a physician, plain radiographs should be considered a routine portion of the diagnostic work-up.  These x-rays usually demonstrate symmetric loss of joint space of the involved joints, often with a generalized osteopenia of the surrounding bone.  There are usually very few osteophytes, although there may be evidence of erosion of the bone where the joint capsule attaches (periarticular erosions).  The joints most commonly involved with rheumatoid arthritis in the hindfoot are the subtalar and talonavicular joints, and superimposed ankle joint involvement is present in many of these patients as well. Since polyarticular RA is common, these patients frequently present with involvement of multiple articulations as opposed to just one.MRI can be helpful in some cases but is certainly not mandatory for making the diagnosis or providing further care in most situations. The study might help demonstrate the soft tissue component of this condition, highlighted by significant thickening and swelling of the joint capsules, with increased fluid in the involved joints.  There may also be evidence of a limited blood supply (avascular necrosis) to some of the bones, such as the navicular.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br /><h3>Non-Operative Treatment</h3><br />Non-operative treatment can be extremely effective in many of these patients upon initial presentation, unless their disease and/or deformity is severe.  The central element of successful non-operative treatment of <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/rheumatoid-arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</a> </strong></em>affecting the hindfoot remains control of the deformity and motion and quelling the inflammatory response.  There now exists a number of effective pharmacologic agents designed to control the inflammatory and destructive components of rheumatoid arthritis, including the use of disease-modifying agents such as antitumor necrosis factor compounds. Medications such as methotrexate may also be used to help to control the condition.  Management and administration of these medications, however, should typically be overseen by a rheumatologist.  The job of the orthopaedist rests with various external methods of symptom and deformity control. The following nonsurgical treatments are helpful in controlling the symptoms from the involved joints:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/activity-modification"><i>Low impact activity modification</i></a></strong> through these involved joints will often help decrease symptoms and swelling. Often activities such as walking on uneven terrain or hard surfaces, can disproportionately aggravate symptoms, so avoidance of such situations can also be very helpful in controlling the patient’s symptoms.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Ankle/hindfoot braces or even orthotics</em> can help limit the motion to the involved joint and, by extension, decrease the symptoms.</li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/comfort-shoes"><i>Comfortable shoe wear</i></a></strong> will provide additional support to these involved joints and also help accommodate any prescribed brace and/or orthotic wear.</li><br /></ul><br /><h3>Operative Treatment</h3><br />When conservative measures fail, surgical management for RA of the hindfoot can be remarkably helpful.  Although unusual, patients can occasionally present quite early in the disease process, and therefore benefit from a minimally invasive synovectomy procedure to eradicate the lining of the involved joint/tendons, and temporarily provide pain relief from the primary symptom-generating joint.  Unfortunately, since this intervention does not stop or treat the RA specifically, the inflammatory process will often gradually recur over time. Under those circumstances, or when patients present initially with more moderate to severe rheumatoid involvement, surgery to fuse the affected joint(s) becomes very beneficial.  This can be equally helpful as a durable long term solution when there is significantly debilitating deformity present.  Specific choice of surgical treatment is dictated by which joints are affected by the arthritis and/or the presence of any associated deformity (ex. flatfoot).  Common variations of these procedures may include:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><strong><i><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/rheumatoid-arthritis-talonavicular-joint">Talonavicular fusion</a> </i></strong>if the talonavicular joint is primarily involved.</li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/subtalar-fusion?wpmp_switcher=mobile"><i>Subtalar fusion</i></a></strong>, if the subtalar joint is involved in isolation.</li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/triple-arthrodesis"><i>Double or Triple arthrodesis</i></a><i> </i></strong>Fusion of the subtalar, talonavicular, and/or calcaneo-cuboid joints is beneficial if some or all of these joints are affected by rheumatoid arthritis, by virtue of significant articular erosion or deformity.</li><br /></ul><br />All of the above procedures can commonly include the use of autogenous bone grafting or the use of other bone graft substitutes to enhance the healing potential, if deemed necessary by virtue of the patient’s various comorbidities.<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><i>Realignment procedures</i>: It may be necessary to combine these procedures with a procedure to rebalance the position of the foot, such as a <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/calcaneal-osteotomy">calcaneal osteotomy</a></strong></em>.  This is done to allow the forces to be loaded centrally through the hindfoot after the patient has recovered from surgery.</li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-fusion-arthrodesis"><i>Ankle fusion</i></a></strong> or <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-replacement"><strong><i>Ankle Replacement</i></strong>:</a> For end-stage involvement of the ankle joint, an ankle fusion or an ankle replacement may be indicated, but this procedure is typically considered separately from any intervention for the hindfoot joints.  Unfortunately, to date there exists no successful joint replacement for any of the hindfoot articulations, so when these are diseased enough to warrant surgery, the procedure of choice remains fusion rather than replacement.</li><br /></ul><br /><h2>Recovery</h2><br />Fusion or arthrodesis surgery of one or more hindfoot joints in patients with RA is usually a highly successful intervention, well received by patients as long as they heal without complication.  While no fusion operation is ideal since by definition it eradicates a natural joint, in this case it is generally pleasing to patients because it still improves function.  What the patients lose in motion (although many begin stiff before surgery anyway due to the disease process), they more than make up for in pain relief, deformity correction, and the ability to stand and walk for longer periods.  Recovery from the surgery depends upon the particular operation, but in general fusion of these major joints requires a 3-6 week period of non weight-bearing and casting, followed by an additional 4-6 week period of progressive mobilization in either a cast or a boot with therapy. Even though most patients are healed and weaned to a regular shoe or sneaker by 3-4 months post-operatively, is not unusual for the patient to require one year to reach the point of maximum medical improvement.  In the absence of complications, a good functional level can generally be expected once the patient is healed after hindfoot surgery.<br /><h2>Potential Complications</h2><br />If surgery is performed, there is always a risk of complication.  These may be somewhat increased in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis.  Although infection and wound healing issues are by far and away the most common issues associated with hindfoot surgery in patients who have RA, the most common constellation of post-operative risks/problems in such patients are:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications"><i>Wound healing problems</i></a></strong></li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications"><i>Infection</i></a></strong></li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications"><i>Blood clots in the legs</i> (DVT)</a></strong></li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications"><i>Pulmonary embolism</i></a></strong></li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications"><i>Nonunion</i></a></strong></li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications"><i>Painful hardware</i></a></strong></li><br /></ul><br /><p>Edited on December 21, 2016</p>
Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/matthew-buchanan-md-editor" target="_blank">Matthew Buchanan, MD</a></strong></em><br /><h2>Summary</h2><br />Talar body fractures are serious injuries to the square-like bone that makes up the lower weight-bearing bone of the ankle joint.  These injuries typically occur from a major load to the ankle joint, such as what occurs following a fall from a height or following a motor vehicle crash.  These fractures can be non-displaced (a hairline crack with no change to the overall shape of the bone) or displaced (the crack in the bone causes the major fragments to shift). Non-displaced or minimally displaced talar body fractures may be treated with a non-weight bearing cast. Displaced talar body fractures will often benefit from surgery to reposition the fractured bone. Both fracture types require a prolonged period of non-weight-bearing in a cast or walking boot to allow for healing (10-12 weeks).  These injuries are often associated with complications or persistent problems, including a relatively high rate of<em> <strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-arthritis">post-traumatic ankle arthritis</a></strong>.</em><br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />The talus is the uppermost bone in your foot that joins up with the end of the shin bone (tibia) to form the ankle joint. The talus bone has a head, a neck, and a body (Figure 1). The body of the talus is the part of the talus bone that connects with the tibia and provides the “up and down” motion of the ankle joint. The talar body is shaped a bit like a square.  It takes a lot of force to fracture the body of the talus (forces typically seen with major car accidents or falls from significant heights).  A fracture of the talar body is a serious injury because the fracture involves the ankle joint.  Patients with a talar body fracture will have a painful, swollen ankle and will be unable to bear weight on their injured extremity.<br /><h5>Figure 1: Talus Anatomy (Talar Body, Neck, and Head)</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Figure-1-Talar-Anatomy.png">^media_display_589c2a2ede9125bcb76932b6/position:center^</a><br /><h2>Imaging</h2><br />This injury can often be diagnosed on plain x-rays.  If the fracture is non-displaced, the x-ray findings may be subtle or even difficult to detect. In the case of significantly displaced talar body fractures, the x-ray findings can be dramatic (Figure 2).  The extent of the injury is seen more clearly on a CT scan (Figure 3), an imaging modality that gives excellent bony detail.  The fracture itself is often akin to a broken egg, as there are many fragments.<br /><h5>Figure 2: X-Rays: Normal versus Displaced Talar Body Fracture</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Figure-2-X-rays-Normal-vs-Displaced-Talar-Body-fracture.png">^media_display_589c2a30de9125bcb76932b9/position:center^</a><br /><h5>Figure 3: CT Scan: Displaced Talar Body Fracture</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Figure-3-CT-Scan-Displaced-Talar-Body-Fracture.png">^media_display_589c2a34de9125bcb76932bc/position:center^</a><br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br /><h3>Non-operative Treatment</h3><br />Occasionally talar body fractures will be non-displaced, or only minimally displaced.  If this is the case, non-operative treatment is possible.  Non-weight bearing in a cast or boot until the fracture has healed would be the treatment of choice for non-displaced fractures of the talar body.  This often requires 8 to 12 weeks of non-weightbearing in order to increase the chance of the fracture healing.  It is often the better part of a year before the patient will reach their point of maximal improvement.<br /><h3>Operative Treatment (ORIF of the Talar Body)</h3><br />Unfortunately, most talar body fractures are displaced.  Displaced talar body fractures often benefit from surgery in an attempt to re-establish the original shape of the bone and thereby minimize the risk of long-term arthritis.  The surgery is described as an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of the talar body.  The surgery involves one or more incisions to enter the ankle joint and reposition the broken bone fragments.  These are then held in place with screws that are buried within the bone so that they do not interfere with the function of the ankle joint itself.  In some instances, wires may also be used to add additional stability to the fixation.  Once the bone has been put back in a better position and stabilized, the wound is then closed.<br /><h2>Recovery</h2><br />Recovery from surgery requires prolonged non-weight bearing (usually 10 to 12 weeks) in a cast or <strong><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/cam-walker-walking-boot">cam boot</a> </em></strong>to allow for adequate bone healing. Physical therapy may be necessary to improve strength and maximize flexibility.<br /><h2>Potential Complications</h2><br /><h3>Specific Complications of Talar Body ORIF</h3><br />Complications that are specific to this injury include:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#non-union"><i>Delayed or nonunion of the fractures</i></a></strong>. The talus bone (and specifically the talar body) has very poor blood supply, and it is not uncommon for some or all the fracture fragments to heal slowly or fail to heal at all due to the blood supply.  This risk will be increased in smokers.</li><br /> 	<li><i>Long Term <strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-arthritis">Ankle Arthritis</a></strong></i>. The body of the talus is the main bone in the lower part of the ankle, and as such it is a critical part of the ankle joint.  A talar body fracture is a significant injury to the ankle joint and will often result in some <strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-arthritis">ankle arthritis</a></strong> that may in some instances be severe.  Even fractures that are perfectly positioned can have significant cartilage damage with resulting ankle arthritis.  This can be akin to a hard boiled egg that is dropped and cracks. Even though the egg maintains its shape, there is still some damage to the outer surface.</li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#nerve-injury"><i>Nerve Injury</i></a>. </strong>There are sensory nerves in this area that may be damaged either directly or with traction in the course of approaching the fractured bone.  These nerve injuries can lead to temporary or permanent sensation loss over certain areas of the foot and/or burning type pain into the foot.</li><br /> 	<li><i>Osteotomy Non-union</i>. In order to surgically fix a talar body fracture, it may be necessary to make a controlled cut (osteotomy) of one of the ankle bones to allow visualization of the broken pieces. For example, the prominent bone on the inside of the ankle (medial malleolus) is often cut in order to provide better exposure to the injury site.  At the conclusion of the surgical fixation of the talar body, this bone would then be stabilized with screws.  In some patients this osteotomy may not heal, creating a painful nonunion that may delay the recovery or require further surgery.</li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/painful-hardware"><i>Painful Hardware</i></a></strong>.<b> </b>Occasionally, there will be hardware that becomes prominent either inside the ankle joint or perhaps in the controlled bone cut (osteotomy) used to expose the area.  If this is the case, it may be necessary to remove this hardware with surgery.</li><br /></ul><br /><h3>General Potential Complications</h3><br />This is an injury that can be associated with:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#infection"><i>Infection</i></a></strong></li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems"><i>Wound healing problems</i></a></strong></li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#dvt"><i>Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)</i></a></strong></li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#pe"><i>Pulmonary embolism</i></a></strong></li><br /></ul><br /><p align="right">Edited December 14, 2016</p><div><hr /><div><br /><div> </div><br /></div><br /></div>

It is caused by a loss of blood supply to one of the bones in the midfoot, (the navicular bone) which leads this bone to collapse before it has fully hardened (become ossified).  Treatment involves time and symptom control, including efforts to limit activities until the symptoms have resolved.  As the blood supply returns to the bone, the symptoms will usually settle.<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />Kohler’s disease typically occurs in children between the ages of 4 and 9, and tends to be more common in boys.  The navicular, which is a bone in the mid part of the foot, loses its blood supply.  This causes the bone to collapse and causes the patient to have pain and swelling in the foot.  It is unclear exactly why some children developed this condition.  It may be related to repetitive trauma in this area, particularly as the navicular bone is the last bone in this area to ossify (become bony).  In addition, blood abnormalities, such as sickle cell anemia, may increase the chance of child developing Kohler’s disease.<br /><h2>Physical Examination</h2><br />Children are likely to have generalized pain in the midfoot, particularly on the inside.  Patients will often walk with a limp and there may be some associated swelling.  Movement of the mid and hindfoot may create discomfort.  The rest of the examination is likely to be normal.<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />The condition is diagnosed on plain x-rays.  The navicular is the last bone in the foot to ossify in children.  The x-rays will show areas of loss of the normal configuration of bone, and the bone itself will appear collapsed from its normal shape.  There will be increased density in the bone.<br /><h2>Treatment of Kohler’s Disease</h2><br />Treatment is symptomatic and may include:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li>Children are placed in <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/comfort-shoes">comfortable supportive shoes</a> or a <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/cam-walker-walking-boot">walker boot</a> to limit the loading to this area.</li><br /> 	<li><strong><em>Minimize weight-bearing activities</em></strong>:  Children should be encouraged to avoid any significant activity loading activities, such as running or jumping, until the condition settles.</li><br /> 	<li><em><strong>Casting</strong></em>:  If the symptoms of Kohler’s disease does not settle, it may be necessary to put children in a short-leg walking cast for up to six weeks, followed by comfort shoes.  This will often allow the bone to settle and the symptoms to improve.</li><br /></ul><br /><h2>Prognosis of Kohler’s Disease</h2><br />Usually the condition is self-limiting, and in rare instances the patient may have residual symptoms as adults.<br /><p align="right"> Edited November 14, 2016</p><br /> 
Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/paul-juliano-md-editor/">Paul Juliano, MD</a></strong></em><br /><h2>Indications</h2><br />Transfering the peroneus longus tendon to the peroneus brevis tendon is a procedure where one of the tendons (peroneus longus) on the outside back part of the ankle (posterolateral) is rerouted to attach where the other tendon (peroneus brevis) normally attaches, on the outside of the midfoot.The main indication for this type of procedure would be dysfunction or disruption of the peroneus brevis tendon, such as may occur in marked<em><strong> <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/peroneal-tendonitis">peroneal tendonitis</a></strong></em>.  Both of the peroneal tendons serve to move the ankle and foot out to the side (eversion), and to help stabilize the ankle and foot when walking.  The peroneus brevis attaches at the base of the mid foot (base of the fifth metatarsal), whereas the peroneus longus tendon runs in a similar direction but then wraps underneath the foot, and attaches on the base of the inside part of the foot (base of the first metatarsal bone).A second less common indication for a peroneus longus to brevis transfer is if the peroneus longus tendon is overactive, causing the base of the great toe to be driven into the ground with each step.  This may be seen in an excessively <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/characteristics-of-high-arched-foot-subtle-cavus">high arched foot</a></strong></em>.  It is common in a condition like <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-cmt-foot-deformities">Charcot-Marie Tooth</a></strong></em>, where patients develop a pronounced high arched foot.  When present, it may lead to pain at the base of the great toe.  This can usually be managed with orthotics and other non-operative means.  However, if non-surgical treatment fails, a peroneus longus to peroneus brevis transfer may be indicated either alone or in combination with other procedures designed to correct the associated deformity.<br /><h2>Procedure</h2><br />Performing a peroneus longus to peroneus brevis transfer procedure involves making an incision on the outside back part of the ankle, and exposing both of the peroneal tendons.  If the peroneus brevis tendon is injured or disrupted and can not be repaired, it is often advantageous to transfer this tendon into the peroneus longus tendon, which runs besides it.  This allows the muscle belly of the peroneus brevis to still function and pull the foot out to the side.  A second incision may need to be made more distally, in order to attach or suture the peroneus longus tendon into the base of the fifth metatarsal, where the peroneus brevis tendon inserts.<br /><h2>Recovery</h2><br />To be successful, this procedure needs the tendon transfer to heal solidly.  This usually requires a minimum of six weeks of either non weight-bearing or relatively limited weight bearing, with the foot and ankle immobilized in either a cast or a CAM walker boot.  After this, the ankle is rehabilitated and the muscles are developed so that they can function in the new manner that they are being used.<br /><h2>Potential Complications</h2><br />Potential complications that are specific to this procedure include:<br /><ul><br />	<li><i>Sural Nerve Injury</i>. An irritation or injury to the sural nerve is relatively common.  The nerve runs near the incision and can be stretched, irritated by scar tissue, or even cut.  If a sural nerve injury develops, there will be numbness and/or a burning sensation on the outside of the foot.</li><br />	<li><i>Failure of the tendon repair</i>. Tendon failure is also a possibility.

<h2>Summary</h2><br />A pilon fracture is a major injury involving ankle joint.  The fracture involves the lower leg bone (tibia) and extends into the weight-bearing part of the ankle joint.  It usually occurs following a major load to the foot such as might occur from a fall from a height.  The bone of the lower part of the ankle (the talus) is driven into the top of the ankle joint causing the fracture.  It is a painful injury associated with a fair bit of swelling.  Treatment is often surgical if the fracture is displaced.  Surgery attempts to restore the shattered bone back to its original position. It often takes many months for the fracture to heal.  Some <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-arthritis" target="_blank">ankle arthritis</a></strong></em> is common even with optimally treated pilon fractures.<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />A pilon fracture is a serious fracture involving the ankle joint.  It is a fracture of the lower part of main bone of the lower leg (the tibia).  The fracture extends into and involves the weight-bearing surface of the ankle joint itself.  This injury occurs from a loading injury to the foot such as would occur during a fall from a height.  Essentially, the foot gets jammed up into the lower part of the lower leg bone (tibia) and resulting in a significant fracture.  A pilon fracture is associated with marked pain and swelling.  Patients will not be able to load any weight on the foot.  The injury is often extremely uncomfortable.  It is common for patients to have other injuries if the cause was a high-energy injury such as fall or a motor vehicle accident.<br /><h2>Physical Examination</h2><br />Physical examination will show significant swelling involving the ankle joint and the lower leg. There may be associated deformity if the ankle fracture is significantly out of position.  It is important to check the nerve and blood supply to the foot, as this can be compromised.  It is also important to check the other muscles, bones and joints to see whether there are any other injuries.  In addition, there is often limited muscle coverage over the ankle.  It is not uncommon for this injury to be open whereby a part of the fracture pokes through the skin.  If this occurs, it is necessary to get this treated surgically in an expedited manner in order to minimize the risk of infection.<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />A plain x-rays will usually allow the injury to be diagnosed.  It will identify the fractures that involve the lower leg bone and extend into the ankle.A CT scan is usually required to view all of the various fracture lines and help the surgeon understand the nature of the fracture pattern which varies considerably from patients to patients.  The defining feature of a Pilon fracture is a fracture that extends into the weight-bearing portion of the ankle - the top part of the ankle joint surface itself.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br /><h4>Non-Operative Treatment</h4><br />Occasionally, either because the fracture is nondisplaced or because surgery is contraindicated, the patient can be treated without surgery.  Non-operative treatment requires a prolonged period (10 to 12 weeks) of non weight-bearing to allow the fracture to heal.  Patients are usually placed in a cast during that time.<br /><h4>Operative Treatment</h4><br />Most Pilon fracture in otherwise healthy individuals are treated with surgical stabilization.  This is often performed once the swelling has settled.  This means that the surgery may be number of days or even weeks after the original injury.  During this time, the foot will be elevated and sometimes it will be placed in an external frame (external fixator) to help stabilize the soft tissues that are often significantly damaged after this type of injury.The surgery itself can be quite complex.  It essentially involves repositioning the fractured bone fragments back into position.  It is particularly important that the bone that makes up the top part of the ankle joint (the tibial plafond) be restored to as close to a normal (anatomic) position as possible.  This procedure is performed through one or more incisions.  Once the fractures are provisionally fixed with wires they are definitively stabilized with a plate and screws -or series of plates and screws.Following the surgery, the patient is kept non-weightbearing until the bone heals which often takes 10 to 12 weeks or more.<br /><h2>Potential Complications</h2><br />This is a potentially very serious high-energy injury with a reasonably high complication rate.  The main surgical complications are:<strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#infection" target="_blank"><i>Infection</i></a></strong><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems" target="_blank"><i>Wound healing issues</i></a></strong><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/painful-hardware" target="_blank"><i>Painful prominent hardware </i></a></strong>This may also be a complication over time.

<h2>Summary: Lateral Talar Fractures</h2><br />A lateral process fracture of the talus is a fracture of the lower bone of the ankle on the outside (lateral) aspect of this bone.  It typically occurs when the foot is jammed suddenly and the outside of the lower ankle bone (talus) is pushed heavily against the adjoining bone (fibula).  This can occur in activities such as snowboarding, which has lead to this being called a &quot;snowboarder's fracture.&quot;  It is associated with pain and swelling.  The patient will often have difficulty walking and may not be able to put weight on the leg.  If the fracture is not displaced, it may be treated with immobilization for 6-8 weeks until the fracture has healed.  If the fracture is displaced, surgery is usually required to stabilize the fracture with screws or remove the fracture fragments.<br /><h5>Figure 1:  Fracture of the Lateral Process of the Talus</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/lateral-process-of-talus-1.jpg">^media_display_589c2a36de9125bcb76932c4/position:center^</a><br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />Patients with lateral talar fractures will usually describe an acute injury where their ankle gets jammed on the outside (lateral side).  This could occur such as when a snowboarder stops suddenly.  Patients will have pain and swelling in the ankle, particularly over the outside aspect.  They will have difficulty walking or be unable to weight-bear.<br /><h2>Physical Examination</h2><br />On examination, patients with a lateral process fracture of the talus will have tenderness and swelling over the outside of the ankle, towards the front.  The findings can be similar to a severe <strong><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/sprained-ankle/">ankle sprain</a></em></strong>.  Often they will be unable to weight bear.  Moving the ankle may increase the pain, and in some cases may cause a cracking sound.<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />It may be possible to see the fracture on a plain x-ray view of the ankle; however, these fractures can be quite subtle on plain x-rays and may be missed.  They can be seen fairly easily on a CT scan or MRI, and one of these tests is often ordered if there are questions as to the nature of the injury.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br />If the fracture itself is completely nondisplaced, it can be treated with relative immobilization of six weeks to allow adequate healing in a cast or <strong><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/foot-and-ankle-medical-supplies/cam-walker-walking-boot/">walker boots</a></em></strong>.  Once x-rays demonstrate adequate healing, activities can be gradually increased.  It is often 3-6 months or more before a full recovery is achieved.Many lateral talar process fractures are displaced or potentially unstable enough to require surgical fixation.  If surgery is indicated, the fracture area is opened up through incision on the outside front of the ankle, and a screw or screws are placed into the fracture to stabilize it to the larger part of the talar body (Figure 2).Occasionally, the fracture will be broken into many pieces (comminuted) that cannot be adequately fixed.  In this case, it may be necessary to remove these bone fragments by cleaning out these fragments (debridement) of the ankle.<br /><h5>Figure 2:  Surgical Fixation of Lateral Process Fracture of the Talus</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/lateral-Process-of-Talus.jpg">^media_display_589c2a37de9125bcb76932c7/position:center^</a><br /><h2>Recovery</h2><br />Typically recovery time from surgery requires six to eight weeks of relative immobilization and non-weight bearing if the fracture has been stabilized (fixed with screws).  If the fracture fragments were just cleaned out (debrided), then weight bearing can be started once the patient feels comfortable.  This is an injury that will often take many months to reach its point of maximum improvement.<br /><h2>Potential Complications</h2><br />Potential complications of surgery include general complications such as:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#infection">Infection</a></strong></em></li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems">Wound healing problems</a></strong></em></li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#dvt">Blood Clot:  Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)</a></strong></em></li><br /> 	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#pe">Pulmonary embolism</a></strong></em></li><br /></ul><br /><h2>Specific Complications</h2><br />Complications that are specific to surgery for a lateral talus process include<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/painful-hardware"><i>Painful hardware</i></a></strong>.  Occasionally hardware (ex. screws) that was used to stablize the fracture will require removal at a later date.</li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications"><i>Nonunion</i></a></strong>:  Sometimes the fracture fragments will fail to heal and need to be removed.</li><br /> 	<li><i><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-arthritis">Arthritis of the Ankle</a></strong> or Subtalar joint</i>.

Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/kenneth-j-hunt-md-editor/">Kenneth Hunt, MD</a></strong></em><br /><h2>Indications</h2><br />Due to a number of mechanical and biologic factors, patients with a base of 5th metatarsal stress fracture (<em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/jones-fracture-5th-metatarsal-stress-fracture">Jones fractures</a></strong></em>) are at risk of inadequate healing and refracture of the bone in the same location. Patients with this injury where it does not adequately heal, or the fracture recurs, may benefit from stabilization of the fracture with a screw placed through the bone. Some highly active and athletic patients benefit from screw fixation after the acute injury to reduce accelerate healing and rehabilitation and reduce the risk of refracture.<br /><h2>Procedure</h2><br />The surgical procedure involves placing an appropriate-sized screw, starting at the tip of the base of the 5th metatarsal, and placing the screw within the bone across the fracture site.  This is done by making a small incision near the base of the 5th metatarsal.  The tip of the 5th metatarsal is identified on x-ray (fluoroscopy).  A drill is then used to enter the canal of the 5th metatarsal, and then placed across the fracture site.  This is done under fluoroscopy to ensure the screw is correctly positioned.  A screw with an appropriate diameter and length is chosen. The diameter is typically 4.5-6.5 mm. and the screw is then positioned across the fracture site so as to stabilizes the bone and compresses the fracture to promote healing of the fracture.<br /><h2>Recovery</h2><br />Recovery from the surgery involves not only the recovery from the actual surgery, but more importantly, time to allow the 5th metatarsal stress fracture (<a href="http://www.footeducation.com/jones-fracture-5th-metatarsal-stress-fracture"><strong><em>Jones fracture</em></strong></a>) to heal (usually six to eight weeks).  The sutures in the small incision will need to be removed after 10 to 14 days.<br /><h2>Potential Complications</h2><br /><h3>General Complications</h3><br />This surgery has the potential for the usual array of postsurgical complications including:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications"><i>Infection</i></a><i> </i></li><br /> 	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems"><i>Wound healing problems</i></a></li><br /> 	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#dvt"><i>Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)</i></a></li><br /> 	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#pe"><i>Pulmonary Embolism (PE)</i></a></li><br /> 	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#nerve-injury"><i>Nerve injury</i></a></li><br /></ul><br /><h3>Specific Complications</h3><br />Specific problems or complications related to 5th metatarsal fracture screw fixation of Jones-type fractures of the 5th metatarsal include:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><i>Continued 5th metatarsal <strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#non-union">non-union</a> </strong>or refracture. </i>The screw is designed to stabilize the bone and make it more likely to heal.  However, it does not affect the underlying foot shape and as such this area may still be getting excessive load.  This may result in either failure to heal the stress fracture or recurrent stress fracture after it has healed. There is usually a mechanical or biologic reason for this complication that a doctor will investigate. For example, patients with very high arches (i.e., cavus foot), and with certain hormonal deficiencies, like vitamin D or thyroid, are at risk of non-union or refracture.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Failure of the Hardware.</em><em> </em> If the stress fracture recurs and the bone breaks, the screw is at risk of breaking as well.  This occurs in the same way that a paper clip breaks by being wiggled back and forth.</li><br /> 	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/painful-hardware"><i>Prominent Hardware</i></a><i>. </i>If the screw head is large and prominent which it often is, some discomfort associated with the screw head may be present.</li><br /> 	<li><em>Further fracturing of the 5th metatarsal. </em>At the time of surgery, or later after the patient has begun weight-bearing, further fracturing of the 5th metatarsal may occur.  During surgery, the drill may go through the other side of the metatarsal bone. Although this is sometimes done on purpose by the surgeon in order to get better fixation,  it can also weaken the bone and, in a small percentage of cases, may lead to another fracture in the bone at a different location.</li><br /></ul><br /> <br /><p align="right">Edited February 1, 2017</p>
Edited by <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/peter-stavrou-md-editor/"><em><strong>Peter Stavrou, MD</strong></em></a><br /><h2>Indications</h2><br />The Ludloff procedure is a surgical technique that can be used to correct a moderately severe <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/bunions-hallux-valgus">bunion</a></strong></em> (hallux valgus) deformity that has failed nonoperative treatment.  Dr Ludloff first described it in 1918.  The surgery is performed by making an oblique cut (osteotomy) in the bone (first metatarsal) that leads to the great toe (Figure 1).  This bone is then rotated to correct the bunion deformity (decrease the 1-2 intermetatarsal angle).  This procedure is combined with an operation to realign the great toe itself.  This is done by tightening up the joint capsule on the inside of the great toe, and loosening the joint capsule on the outside of the great toe.<br /><h2>Procedure</h2><br />The Ludloff procedure itself involves making an cut (incision) on the top or inside of the foot to expose the bone that the great toe originates from (first metatarsal).  Once this bone is exposed, it is cut obliquely and prior to completing the cut, a screw hole is placed with a screw partially in position.  The bone is then rotated so that the far end of the bone (first metatarsal) is in an improved position, lessening the bunion deformity.  The bone is then further stabilized with other screws, or occasionally a plate.  The great toe joint is then stabilized in an improved position by tightening up the joint capsule on the inside (medial), in order to improve the position of the great toe.<br /><h4>Figure 1- Ludloff Bone Cut</h4><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Figure-1-Ludloff-Bone-cut.png">^media_display_589c2a39de9125bcb76932cc/position:center^</a><br /><h2>Recovery from the Ludloff Procedure</h2><br />Success of the Ludloff procedure requires the bone that has been cut to heal.  This healing usually takes six weeks or longer.  During this healing period, it is not usually possible to fully weight bear, requiring some weight bearing through the heel,and limited walking in a stiff soled shoe or boot.  Once the bone is fully healed, activity can be increased.  It is important to keep the great toe joint moving with some controlled exercises.  Often by 8 to 12 weeks post surgery, it is possible for the patient to return to a normal shoe, provided it has a wide toe box.  For many patients, the big toe often remains slightly swollen, so it is important not to wear tight shoes.<br /><h2>Potential Complications</h2><br /><strong>General Complications</strong>Although uncommon, there are a variety of potential general complications that could occur.  These include:<br /><ul><br />	<li><strong><a

Edited by <strong><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/gwyneth-devries-md-frcsc-editor/">Gwyneth deVries, MD FRCSC</a></em></strong><br /><h2>Indications</h2><br />A Percutaneous TendoAchilles lengthening (PTAL) is a procedure that lengthens the Achilles tendon. This lengthening is needed if the ankle joint has limited motion in an upward direction (for example the person can easily walk on the toes, but not on the heels). A shortened or tight calf muscle is called an equinus contracture, and the lengthening surgery improves the ability for the ankle to move upwards (dorsiflexion). This may be indicated in children with an <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/equinus-contractures">equinus contracture</a></strong></em> (inability to fully bring the foot upwards) such as may occur in <strong><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/clubfoot-deformity-talipes-equinovarus">clubfoot deformity</a></em></strong>.  It also may be indicated in adults who have a <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/acquired-adult-flatfoot-deformity-posterior-tibial-tendon-dysfunction">flatfoot deformity</a></strong></em>, a contracture due to stroke, or have <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/diabetes">diabetic foot</a></strong></em> issues which have caused an equinus contracture.<br /><h2>Procedure<b> </b></h2><br />A percutaneous Achilles tendon lengthening is performed in the operating room or other designated procedure setting. The procedure is not lengthy, and is done through a series of small incisions over the Achilles tendon, at the back of the lower leg.  Typically, the three-incision technique described by Hoke in the 1930’s is used.  In this procedure, the Achilles is identified, and, using the first small incision (often called a “stab” incision) the tendon is cut part way through. .  The first incision is made close to where the tendon inserts into the heel bone (Calcaneus).  The cut is done in such a way that the scalpel is taken through the skin and half of the tendon is cut – usually the inside (medial) half.  The second incision is then made one half to one inch (1-2cm) further up the leg.  Again, half of the Achilles is cut but in this case the opposite half to what was previously cut; usually the outside (lateral) half.  A third incision is then made still further up the leg, usually one-half to one inch (1-2cm) from the second incision.  This third incision releases the inner half of the tendon.  After half of the tendon has been cut in each of these three spots, gentle pressure is applied to the foot.  This allows the fibers of the cut areas of tendon to slide over each other and the Achilles tendon is gently lengthened.  At this point, the incisions are closed and the patient is immobilized with the ankle joint in a neutral angle (right angle) position.<br /><h2>Recovery</h2><br />The cut Achilles tendon does need to heal.  In adults, this typically requires six weeks of relative immobilization in a cast, boot, or splint.  Partial weightbearing is often possible early on. This is often followed by another six weeks of gradual increasing of activity.  The actual recovery may be dictated more by the other procedures that are often done in addition to the Achilles lengthening.Patients may experience an aching or cramping of the calf muscle for a few days after surgery. The incision sites may be tender initially, but heal quickly.<br /><h2>Potential Complications</h2><br /><strong>General Complications</strong>Like other operative procedures, there are general complications that may occur when a percutaneous Achilles lengthening is performed.  In children, the complications are generally much less severe, but can still occur. Fortunately because of the small incisions, these complications are relatively uncommon but may include:<br /><ul><br />	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#infection"><i>Infection</i></a></strong></li><br />	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications"><i>Wound healing problems</i> </a></strong></li><br />	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#dvt"><i>Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)</i> </a></strong></li><br />	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#pe"><i>Pulmonary Embolism (PE)</i></a></strong></li><br /></ul><br /><strong>Specific Complications</strong>Complications that are specific to this procedure include:<br /><ul><br />	<li><i><strong>Rupture of the Achilles tendon</strong>. </i>When performing a percutaneous Achilles lengthening, it is quite possible to over-lengthen or rupture the Achilles during the surgery. This may require a more definitive open surgical assessment of the Achilles tendon, or may lead to a longer period of casting/bracing and specific exercises to promote healing of the tendon at the desired length.</li><br />	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/sural-neuritis/"><i>Sural Nerve</i></a>. </strong>A sural nerve injury may also occur.  This nerve runs on the outer side of the lower leg, and can be accidentally injured during one of the incisions.  If this nerve is cut or injured, there may be numbness on the outside of the foot and/or some burning-type pain at the site of the nerve injury.</li><br />	<li><em><strong>Postoperative swelling</strong>.</em> The surgery causes some weakness of the calf muscle. The muscle usually “pumps” fluid up the leg. This can be short-lived, or last for several months.</li><br />	<li><strong><em>Calf weakness</em></strong>. The lengthened tendon means that the calf muscle may work differently, or the new position of the foot may feel awkward or weak when walking up stairs or ladders, or if attempting to jump, sprint or stand on the toes.</li><br /></ul><br /><p align="right">Edited November 18, 2015</p><br /> 
<h2>Indications</h2><br />The naviculocuneiform joint is a joint between the navicular bone and the cuneiform bones (Figure 1).  The joint is located in the mid part of the foot, on the inside.  Occasionally this joint may become arthritic or it may become excessively mobile in the case of a marked-acquired adult flatfoot deformity.  In some instances, it may be beneficial to fuse this joint (arthrodesis).Figure 1- Naviculo-Cuneiform Joint<a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Figure-1-Naviculocuneiform-Joint.png">^media_display_589c2a3bde9125bcb76932d1/position:center^</a><br /><h2>Procedure</h2><br />A naviculocuneiform fusion involves making an incision on the top or slightly to the side of the mid foot, and the joint is then identified.  The joint is then exposed and the cartilage covering the joint surface is removed.  The remaining bony surface is prepared for fusion, and then the joint itself is stabilized with screws or plates.  In some instances, a bone graft will be applied to increase the chance of healing.<br /><h2>Recovery</h2><br />Recovery from surgery to fuse the naviculocuneiform joint may be dictated by other surgeries that have been done in conjunction with this procedure.  However, typical recovery from this procedure is six weeks of non-weightbearing, in order to facilitate healing.  In some situations, it may be possible to bear some weight through the heel during this initial recovery period.  It is not uncommon for fusion of the naviculocuneiform joint to require a longer period of non-weightbearing in order to facilitate healing, as the blood supply to this area can be tenuous.  Once the bone is healed, the patient can gradually increase activity initially in a stiff-soled boot and eventually in a <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/comfort-shoes">comfortable shoe</a>.  It is common for this surgery to take 9 or 12 months to reach the point of full recovery.<br /><h2>Potential Complications</h2><br /><h4><i>General Complications</i></h4><br />As with other surgeries, there is always a risk of general complications which may include:<br /><ul><br />	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems" target="_blank"><i>Wound healing problems</i></a></strong></li><br />	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#infection" target="_blank"><i>Infection</i></a></strong></li><br />	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#dvt" target="_blank"><i>Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)</i></a></strong></li><br />	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#pe" target="_blank"><i>Pulmonary embolism</i></a></strong></li><br /></ul><br /><h4><i>Specific Complications</i></h4><br />Complications that are specific to a naviculocuneiform fusion include:<br /><ul><br />	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#non-union" target="_blank"><i>Nonunion</i></a></strong><i> of the naviculocuneiform joint.  </i>This is a difficult joint to fuse.  It often has poor blood supply.  In addition, it may be more mobile than normal in the case of some with acquired flat foot deformity, and this mobility can put increased force through the joint as it heals, predisposing to a nonunion.</li><br />	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#nerve-injury" target="_blank"><i>Nerve Injury</i></a>. </strong>An injury to one or more nerves in the vicinity of the incision can occur.  The two most common nerves that are involved are the saphenous nerve on the inside of the foot, and one of the branches of the superical peroneal nerve on the top of the foot.

Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/kenneth-j-hunt-md-editor/">Kenneth Hunt, MD</a></strong></em><br /><h2>Indications</h2><br />In patients with a chronic <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/achilles-tendon-rupture">Achilles rupture</a></strong></em>, the Peroneus Longus (PL) tendon may be used to reinforce or even replace the Achilles tendon.  This procedure may also be indicated if the Achilles has been lost through deep infection or through severe or repeated injury requiring its removal. This procedure has a similar goal as the <strong><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/flexor-hallucis-longus-fhl-tendon-transfer-to-the-achilles-tendon">Flexor Hallucis Longus (FHL) transfer to the Achilles</a> </em></strong>tendon, but uses the peroneus longus muscle tendon unit rather that the FHL. A (PL) to Achilles tendon transfer is done to restore plantarflexion strength across the ankle joint and reduce pain associated with a chronically injured or degenerated Achilles tendon.<br /><h2>Procedure</h2><br />The peroneus longus tendon runs on the outside of the lower leg, behind the outside of the ankle joint.  The procedure typically involves an incision to harvest the tendon on the outside of the mid foot, where the tendon wraps around to the bottom of foot.  It is released at the bottom of the foot to maximize the length of the tendon for transfer. A second incision may then be used on the outside back of the lower leg, where the Achilles can also be accessed, to find the PL tendon and muscle belly in the back of the ankleand free it up.  The tendon is then pulled into the back of the lower leg incision It is then attached into the far (distal) stump of the Achilles and/or into the heel bone (calcaneus) through that same incision, or through a third incision made on the outside of the heel if needed. The transferred PL tendon is placed to an appropriate tension to give the best amount of tissue and strength, and attached through drill holes with suture, or to the bone with interference screws.<br /><h2>Recovery</h2><br />Recovery requires the transferred peroneus longus tendon to heal solidly.  For this reason, patients are usually kept non-weight bearing for a minimum of six weeks, to allow the tendon transfer to scar in, heal, and consolidate.  At that point, patients can begin gradually increasing their activity level.  A physical therapy program working on recovering range of motion, strengthening, retraining this muscle, and restoring normal gait, is usually started at this time.  It is usually many months or even more than a year before the patient has reached their maximal recovery.<br /><h2>Complications</h2><br /><strong>General Complications</strong>Complications, although unlikely, may include:<br /><ul><br />	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#infection"><i>Infection</i></a></strong></li><br />	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems"><i>Wound healing complications</i></a></strong></li><br />	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#dvt"><i>Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)</i></a></strong></li><br />	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#pe"><i>Pulmonary Embolism (PE)</i></a></strong></li><br /></ul><br /><strong>Specific Complications</strong>Potential complications that are specific to the Peroneus Longus to Achilles transfer include:<br /><ul><br />	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/sural-neuritis/"><i>Sural nerve injury</i></a></strong>.

Edited by <strong><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/vinod-k-panchbhavi-md-editor">Vinod Panchbhavi MD</a></em></strong><br /><h2>Summary</h2><br />Compartment syndrome of the lower leg is a condition characterized by intense pain and swelling in the leg over the involved muscles.  These muscles are confined in relatively unyielding compartments formed by the thick fibrous tissue (fascia) and bony walls that surrounds them, and when they swell they can sometimes reach a point where blood will not reach (perfuse) the muscles. This results in intense pain and eventual muscle death.  <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/compartment-syndrome-of-the-lower-leg-acute">Compartment syndrome </a>often occurs in the setting of a trauma, such as a lower leg (tibia) fracture.  However, it can also occur following exercise in patients that are at risk.<br /><h2>History</h2><br />Exercise-induced compartment syndrome classically presents with marked pain in the lower leg, usually in the front or side of the lower leg following an episode of intense or prolonged exercise or activity.  There may be associated numbness in the foot, and the muscles lifting the foot up may become dysfunctional, leading to difficulty in lifting the foot up, a condition called ‘foot drop’ or ‘drop foot’.  A common scenario is a patient who is playing an intense game such as tennis and develops pain, numbness, and a <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/drop-foot">drop foot.</a>  If they stop playing, the symptoms will usually resolve, although there can be a low level dysfunction of the involved muscles.  In a worst-case scenario, the muscles do not become adequately oxygenated (perfused) after the exercises stop, and there is some muscle death.<br /><h2>Physical Exam</h2><br />Patients with an exercise-induced compartment syndrome of the lower leg will often have a fairly normal physical exam when they are not exercising.  However, the symptoms can be reproduced if they exercise.  This would include a hard swelling of the muscles usually in the front or side of the lower leg, as well as weakness, and difficulty or inability to lift the foot up.  There may also be numbness on the top of the foot as the nerves supplying this area run through the compartments in the front and side of the leg.In an effort to reproduce the symptoms, patients may be asked to exercise and then the compartment pressures could be measured.  If they are noted to be within 20 or 30 mm of the lower blood pressure measurement (the diastolic pressure), then the diagnosis of compartment syndrome would be made.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br />Treatment of exercise induced compartment syndrome initially may involve avoiding aggravating activities.  There are often just a few very specific activities that will precipitate symptoms, and if the patient can avoid these then they can usually function without any other intervention.<br /><h3>Surgical Treatment</h3><br />For persistent exercise-induced compartment syndrome or compartment syndrome that is recurrent and debilitating, release of the involved strong tissue (the fascia) that confines the muscles is indicated.  Essentially this involves cutting through skin and the soft tissues down to the tense tight fascia overlying the involved muscles.  This fascia is cut, creating a space for the muscle to expand into and therefore allowing for adequate perfusion when the muscles are being used.Occasionally an acute exercise event, such as a long tennis match or a running race, may produce compartment syndrome that does not resolve.  This is a surgical emergency and would require a release on an urgent basis of the involved tense compartments.  If release does not occur within an adequate time, there is often death of the muscles with associated dysfunction such as a <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/drop-foot">drop foot</a>. <br /><p>Edited January 11, 2017</p><div></div>
Edited by <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/mark-perry-md/"><strong><em>Mark Perry MD</em></strong></a><br /><h2>Summary</h2><br />Compartment syndrome of the lower leg is a very painful and potentially devastating condition. It is often associated with trauma, such as a shin bone (tibia) fracture or crush injury.  Any condition that causes excessive swelling of the muscles in the lower leg can cause compartment syndrome. The swollen muscles are confined by the thick and fibrous tissue (fascia) that runs around the lower leg.There are four compartments in the lower leg – one in the front (anterior), one on the side (lateral), and two on the back (posterior). If the muscle tissue swells excessively, it can reach the point where blood cannot deliver oxygen to the muscles or nerves. This creates intense pain and may lead to muscle death after approximately six hours. If this occurs, these muscles will not recover.Treatment of an acute compartment syndrome is urgent surgical release of the constricting fascia (fasciotomy) allowing blood flow and oxygenation to the muscle and nerves.<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />A typical scenario for the development of a lower leg compartment syndrome is a patient who suffered a high-energy trauma (car accident, gun shot, fall from a ladder). If there is excessive swelling (Figure 1), the patient may develop intense pain in the leg after the injury or even after fixation of the broken bone. In the hospital setting, patients with compartment syndrome usually demonstrate increased demand for pain medication to overcome the intense pain.In patients with multiple injuries, including head trauma, tests involving direct pressure measurement with needles may be necessary. Serial examination, close observation, and clinical suspicion are essential to early diagnosis.<a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/compartment-syndrome-of-the-lower-leg-exercise-induced/">External or exercise-induced compartment syndrome of the lower leg</a> may also occur as a result of intense chronic repetitive use. For example, an individual who runs a marathon with inadequate training may cause such muscle damage and swelling that a compartment syndrome develops.<br /><h5>Figure 1: Excessive swelling related to Compartment Syndrome (courtesy of Mark Perry MD)</h5><br />^media_display_589c2a3cde9125bcb76932d7/position:center^<br /><h2>Physical Examination</h2><br />Physical examination can be subtle, although the classic signs are quite striking. The main sign is intense pain in the lower leg when an examiner moves the muscles within that compartment. For example, moving the ankle or the toes results in excruciating pain. Numbness in the foot and even loss of pulses may develop. Examination of the leg will show that instead of being soft and “push-ale” the involved muscular compartment becomes “rock hard” when pressed.<br /><h2>Imaging and Investigations</h2><br />There are no specific imaging studies that will diagnose compartment syndrome, although x-rays may show a fracture that could possibly result in causing a compartment syndrome.The main diagnostic criterion is a good clinical exam. Pressure monitoring of the compartments with a pressure-sensitive needle can confirm the diagnosis. There are several ways to interpret the pressure “number” either by the absolute value or its relation to the blood pressure.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br />If compartment syndrome is diagnosed or is clinically suspected, the treatment is surgical release fascia of the leg. The muscles will then bulge out (Figure 2; and note the darker color of the muscle bulging through the white fascia). Muscle that does not appear to be healthy is removed. After releasing the tight fascia the muscles and nerves begin to receive adequate oxygenated blood to keep the tissue alive.This type of surgery is done on an urgent basis. Often after surgery, it may not be possible to close the incisions because of the excessive swelling (Figure 3). Sterile dressings can be applied to the wounds and the patient can return to the operating room later for removal of more muscle, delayed wound closure, or a skin graft.<br /><h5>Figure 2: Releasing fascia of the leg (courtesy of Mark Perry MD)</h5><br />^media_display_589c2a3cde9125bcb76932da/position:center^<br /><h5>Figure 3: excessive swelling makes it difficult to close incisions (courtesy of Mark Perry MD)</h5><br />^media_display_589c2a3ede9125bcb76932dd/position:center^ <br /><h2>Sequela of compartment syndrome</h2><br />If a compartment syndrome occurs and there is muscle death, the tissues in this area will be permanently damaged. In the lower leg fixed foot or ankle positions may need surgery to place the foot in a “more usable” alignment. The foot may not be able to bend up or bent “down and in” depending on the involved compartments. Damage to nerves may result in pain or increased sensitivity.To avoid later problems, an acute compartment syndrome of the lower leg is a true orthopedic emergency. <br /><p>Edited December 19th 2016</p><br /><p>Previously edited by <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/hussein-pazkad-md/">Hossein Pakzad MD</a></p>
<h2>Indications</h2><br />The indications for this procedure is the correction of a deformity whereby the front and mid part of the foot is splayed to the outside (abducted).  This deformity is often seen in a <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/acquired-adult-flatfoot-deformity-posterior-tibial-tendon-dysfunction">flatfoot deformity</a></strong></em> or a deformity in children associated with a tarsal coalition.<br /><h2>Procedure</h2><br />The Evans procedure is performed to correct a specific deformity of the foot.  When the foot is splayed out to the side, it can sometimes be helpful to lengthen the outside column (lateral column) of the foot, pushing the front of the foot into a more neutral position.  The Evans procedure itself involves making an incision on the outside of the foot just near the front of the ankle.  The front part of the heel bone (calcaneus) is then cut.  This bone is then pried apart 8 to 10 mm, and a bone graft either from the pelvis or from a cadaver is used to maintain this lengthening.  The cut (osteotomy) for the Evans procedure is performed just behind the calcaneal cuboid joint.  By making the cut through the front part of the calcaneus bone instead of lengthening and fusing through the calcaeno-cuboid joint, the motion of this joint can be maintained.  The Evans procedure is often performed in conjunction with other procedures in order to have a more complete correction of an <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/acquired-adult-flatfoot-deformity-posterior-tibial-tendon-dysfunction">acquired adult flatfoot deformity</a></strong></em>.  These other procedures may include a <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/calcaneal-osteotomy">calcaneal osteotomy</a></strong></em>, a flexor tendon transfer to the posterior tibial tendon or an <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/percutaneous-tendoachilles-lengthening"><em><strong>Achilles lengthening</strong></em></a>, or <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/gastrocnemius-slide-strayer-procedure">gastrocnemius resection</a></strong></em>.<br /><h2>Recovery</h2><br />This procedure involves cutting (osteotomizing) a bone (calcaneus) in the foot.  For the procedure to be effective, the bones must knit together.  This usually takes six to eight weeks of healing time.  During this time, it is usually necessary to keep the area immobilized and weight off of the foot.  Once the area has healed enough to bear weight, the patients are often placed in a <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/cam-walker-walking-boot">walking boot</a> </strong></em>and they are asked to gradually increase their activities over a further six to eight week period.  It is often a year or more before a full recovery is achieved.<br /><h2>Potential Complications</h2><br />Complications that may occur with the Evans procedure that are specific to this procedure include:<br /><ul><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#non-union">Malunion</a></strong></em></li><br /></ul><br />Over or under lengthening of the bone cut can be problematic.  Under lengthening will result in an incomplete correction of the deformity.  Over lengthening can result in a foot that is painful and stiff.  It is not uncommon even in a well performed Evans procedure for the patient to have significant stiffness and discomfort for many months after this surgery, as the foot accommodates to the new position.<br /><ul><br />	<li>Pain associated with the lateral hind foot.</li><br /></ul><br />There can be pain associated with the lateral hind foot where the procedure is performed.  This can occur because there is now increased pressure to the calcaneal cuboid joint.  This is what is known as lateral column overload.<br /><ul><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/painful-hardware">Painful Hardware</a></strong></em></li><br /></ul><br />The bone graft needs to be fixed and placed, either with screws or a plate.

<h2>Indications</h2><br />Extensor substitutions are performed as a surgical treatment for <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/claw-toes">clawing of the toes</a> </strong></em> 2, 3, 4, and 5 (the lesser toes).  When excessive pull of the tendons that pulls the toes upwards (long extensor tendons) occurs, these toes will tend to flex up which predisposes them to the claw toe deformity.  The <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/claw-toes">extensor</a></strong></em> substitution is designed to alleviate and decrease the pull from the extensor tendons.<br /><h2>Procedure</h2><br />The procedure itself involves making an incision over the top of the forefoot, often at the oblique.  The extensor tendons are identified and are then cut.  These tendons are then often sutured into the mid foot or the tendon on the side of the foot, so that the pull from the muscles will still serve to flex up the ankle joint but not the toes.  The far ends of the tendons are then attached to the smaller extensor tendons that originate in the foot extensor digitorum longus (EDB) tendons. This is performed so that the tendons are in a more lengthened position. This has two effects; First, there is lengthening of the extensor tendons so that the clawed toes tend to fall back into a more neutral position;  Second, the smaller muscle belly in the foot is not as strong, and therefore there is not going to be as much dynamic force on the toes.  This makes it less likely for the deformity to recur.Indications for this procedure are <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/claw-toes">clawtoe</a></strong></em> deformities of the lesser toes.  This is procedure is often performed when the clawtoe deformities are flexible (the toes can still be straightened) and a less powerful correction is indicated.<br /><h2>Recovery</h2><br />Recovery from this procedure requires a six-week period of relative immobilization of the toes.  This is often done by pinning the toes in a straight position.  This allows the tendon repairs to heal.  During this time, patients may be allowed to weight bear through the heel, but they are often encouraged to significantly limit their weight bearing activities.<br /><h2>Potential Complications</h2><br />Complications that are specific to the extensor substitution procedure include:<br /><ul><br />	<li><i>Failure of the tendon transfers to knit together.</i>  This may result in limited or absent extension of the involved toe.</li><br />	<li><i>Incomplete or over correction of the toe deformity</i>.  It can sometimes be quite difficult to get the lesser toes perfectly aligned and to ensure that the tension from the new muscle unit that has been transferred into the tendon is working appropriately. Therefore, the toes may not line up in a perfectly even manner.</li><br />	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#nerve-injury"><i>Nerve injury</i></a></strong>.  There can be injury to the sensory nerves that supply the top of the foot with resulting numbness or burning sensation over the top of the foot, extending into the toes.</li><br /></ul><br /> <br /><p align="right">Edited April 24, 2015</p><div></div>

The peroneal tendons normally serve to pull the foot out to the side (evert the foot).  Dysfunction of the peroneal tendons can occur from severe inflammation and irritation of the peroneal tendons (tendonitis), leading to a rupture of the peroneal tendons over time.  Alternatively, paralysis of the peroneal muscles may be an indication for this type of surgery.  These indications are quite uncommon, and usually when one of the peroneal tendons is torn or dysfunctional, the other tendon can compensate or be substituted in its place.<br /><h2>Procedure</h2><br />The flexor hallucis longus tendon is cut or detached from its insertion.  This is often performed through two incisions. The FHL is first identified on the outside (posterolateral) part of the ankle.  Through an incision, the muscle belly and then the tendon are identified.  It is possible to release the tendon here, although it is often released through a second incision; a small incision on the inside (medial side) of the foot can be used to identify the tendon.  The tendon is then cut near the base of the big toe in the sole of the foot.  The cut FHL tendon is brought out through the initial incision behind the ankle.Once the FHL tendon has been harvested, it is re-routed behind the ankle to where the peroneus brevis tendon normally inserts at the base of the small toe on the outside of the foot.  The FHL tendon is then sutured into the stump of the peroneus brevis tendon or anchored into bone at the the base of the small toe.<br /><h2>Recovery</h2><br />For this procedure to be successful, the FHL tendon needs to heal completely to its newly transferred position.  This usually takes a minimum of six weeks, and during this time, immobilization (in a cast or a walking boot) and limited or no weight bearing is required.  Following this healing period, the FHL tendon must be retrained to do its new job: everting the foot.  This can be challenging as the brain is used to having the muscle flex the great toe and now it is being asked to evert the foot.  Often the FHL never fully regains normal function, but can still provide the strength to stabilize the foot and ankle and relieve pain.<br /><h2>Potential Complications</h2><br />Specific complications associated with the flexor hallucis longus transfer to the peroneus brevis may include:<br /><ul><br />	<li><em>Great toe weakness. </em>This procedure can result in some <em>increased weakness of great toe flexion</em>.  However, this is usually not a clinically significant problem as there is another tendon that flexes the great toe.</li><br />	<li><i>Failure to fully restore function of the peroneal muscles. </i>It<i> </i>is unrealistic to expect to regain full strength in eversion equivalent to normal peroneal function, but the procedure can usually stabilize the ankle and foot adequately even without restoring full strength</li><br />	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#nerve-injury"><i>Nerve injuries</i></a></strong><i>.  </i>There is a major nerve in the back part of the foot called the tibial nerve which supplies the sensation to the sole of the foot as well as to some muscles in the sole of the foot.  In rare instances, this can be injured with resulting pain and/or loss of function of this nerve.</li><br /></ul><br /> <br /><p align="right">Edited August 15, 2015</p>
Edited by <em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/gwyneth-devries-md-frcsc-editor/"><strong>Gwyneth deVries, MD</strong></a></em><br /><h2>Procedure</h2><br />An Ankle cheilectomy (Bone spur removal) is used to treat <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/anterior-ankle-impingement">anterior ankle impingement </a></strong></em>resulting from certain injuries or from<em><strong> <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-arthritis">ankle arthritis</a>.</strong></em> Anterior ankle impingement is a term describing a pinching or painful sensation at the front of the ankle joint.   There may be bony lumps or other swelling that can be felt beneath the skin.  Certain x-rays, bone scans or 3-dimensional imaging (CT scan or MRI) will help to show the ankle joint structures and the bone spurs clearly. This surgery may be offered if non-surgical  treatment is not effective.Patients with anterior impingement may experience symptoms when walking uphill, or with squatting (when the front of the shin moves toward the foot). Sometimes, patients will feel weakness or instability of the ankle due to pain, or may feel that they are “walking with the foot turned outward”.Various scenarios are taken into account before planning ankle cheilectomy. For example, if the bone spurs are thought to be related to certain sports (such as repetitive contact of a ball to that part of the ankle) then bone and joint changes are usually found only at the front of the ankle joint.  When most of the joint is healthy, and only the front of the joint shows changes or spurs,  then removing the prominent impinging bone spurs and/or soft tissue can help symptoms considerably.If there is evidence of injury to other parts of the ankle (from fractures or sprains) or <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-arthritis"><em>ankle arthritis</em></a> then sometimes only partial relief of symptoms can be expected from removing bone spurs and scar tissue from the front part of the ankle. In some instances, surgery to remove the bone spurs can contribute to an unwanted <em>increase</em> in a patient’s symptoms since the surgery is designed to allow the ankle joint to move more, (and more movement may irritate the other damaged areas of the ankle).  Generally speaking more arthritis usually means less benefit from the cheilectomy procedure.<br /><h2>Surgery</h2><br />Surgical treatment involves removing the prominent bone spurs and/or soft tissue or scar tissue.  This is done either <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ankle-arthroscopy">arthroscopically</a></strong></em>, or by opening up the ankle joint with an incision. An ankle cheilectomy for small areas of spurs/tissue can usually be performed arthroscopically.  However, if the bone spurs are large, it is often more efficient and effective to make a larger incision, open up the ankle joint, and remove the bone spurs.  Removal of all bone spurs is not required; rather only those bone spurs that are noted to be causing impingement at the time of surgical inspection are removed.  The procedure is typically day surgery.<br /><h2>Recovery</h2><br />Recovery requires limited activities for 6-8 weeks, during which time the patient’s ankle will be swollen and painful.  However, patients may be able to weight-bear immediately after surgery if an ankle cheilectomy was the only procedure performed. Crutches and/or an air walker brace may be prescribed to enhance comfort after the procedure. Physical therapy to gradually mobilize the joint safely and comfortably will often be prescribed as well.  It is important to recognize that ligaments and tendons may be tight before surgery, and may remain so even after surgery and rehabilitation.  This may contribute to less improvement than expected in some cases.The bone spurs themselves often tend to ‘grow back’ gradually over time. Therefore, recurrence of symptoms is possible. Athletes may continue to experience mild or moderate symptoms in the long term. <br /><p align="right">Edited on February 22, 2016</p>
If the <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ganglion-cysts" target="_blank">ganglion cyst</a></strong></em> is painful and does not settle with non-surgical management, then surgical removal (resection) may be indicated. Surgical resection of the ganglion cyst can be successful, provided the origin of the cyst is removed.Surgery involves making an incision over the mass and gently dissecting around the fluid-filled mass.  It is important that the stalk of the ganglion be resected.  The stalk is the area that communicates with the joint or tendon sheath, where the ganglion cyst originates from. Following removal of the ganglion cyst, bleeding from the wound is stopped and then the wound is closed.<br /><h2><i>Potential Complications</i></h2><br />Surgical resection of ganglion cysts may be associated with a surprisingly high rate of wound complications, as there is a tendency for synovial fluid to continue to drain from the wound.

This joint capsule surrounds the joint and gets stretched out over time, as the big toe deviates towards the outside (lateral deviation). This reshaping or changing the capsular tissue is called capsulorraphy 1st MTP ( big Toe) medial capsulorraphy (tightening of the capsule) is usually performed as part of a bunion correction in which the end of the big toe metatarsal bone is cut or reshaped as in in an osteotomy (“bone cut”) procedure.<br /><h2>Procedure</h2><br />The procedure is typically performed by making an incision on the inside of the great toe.  In some cases surgeons can perform a dorsal incision on the top of the toe and expose both sides to release the tight lateral side and tighten the loose inside capsule tissue. The capsule is exposed and then the capsule is opened either longitudinally, vertically, or with an L-shaped incision.  Once the joint is exposed, it is inspected and any loose bodies, bone spurs, or debris is removed.   It may also be necessary or beneficial to release the joint capsule on the outside (lateral) aspect of the joint, as this is often tight.  With the big toe in a corrected (straightened) position, the medial joint capsule is repaired in such a way that it is tightened.  The skin is then closed.<br /><h2>Potential complications</h2><br /><ul><br />	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems"><i>Wound Infection</i></a></strong></li><br />	<li><strong><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#nerve-injury">Nerve injury</a></strong></strong>.

The crescentic osteotomy involves an incision on the inside (medial aspect) of the forefoot, and then a semicircular bone cut (osteotomy) through the base of the 1st metatarsal (the bone that leads to the great toe).  The two parts of the cut bone are then rotated to change the position of the bone and help correct the bunion deformity.  The cut bone fragments are then stabilized with screws or a plate.  This procedure is usually combined with a <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/great-toe-medial-capsulorraphy-1st-mtp"><strong><em>1st MTP joint capsularraphy</em></strong></a> (tightening of the soft tissue on the inside of the big toe).<br /><h2>Procedure</h2><br />As this procedure involves cutting the bone, about 6 weeks of limited weight-bearing is required to allow the bone to heal. <br /><p align="right">Edited April 10, 2015</p>
Edited by <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/daniel-guss-md-2/"><em><strong>Daniel Guss, MD</strong></em></a><br /><h2>Indication</h2><br /><p>In some individuals with <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/claw-toes/">claw toes</a></strong></em>, the toe deformity remains flexible so that when examining the toe in clinic, the toe can be still be pulled straight.  This is in contrast to more long-standing claw toes which often become rigid and fixed in a bent position.  When the toe deformity is flexible, a simple surgical release of the tendon that excessively bends the toe (the Flexor Digitorum Longus) may be beneficial.  This procedure can be done quickly with a nick in the skin on the undersurface of the toe and a release of the tight tendon, a technique known as percutaneous release.</p><h2>Procedure</h2><br />The procedure does not fully control the position of the toe, and in some instances the toe can ride into a high, more extended position.  This is because release of the flexor tendon that bends the toe still leaves the extensor tendon that raises the toe intact, allowing the extensor tendon to lift the toe upwards.  For this reason, this procedure is often reserved for the 4th or 5th toes, where this is less troublesome, or for patients who can only tolerate a minor procedure. <br /><p align="right">Edited July 5, 2015</p>
<h2>Summary</h2><br />Sever's disease is characterized by heel pain in a growing adolescent.  It occurs when the growth plate (<em>Apophysis</em>) in the heel is subject to excessive repetitive force.  It tends to occur in active, rapidly growing children, and it is more common in boys.  The condition is named after James Sever, who was the American orthopaedic surgeon who described the condition in 1912.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br />The condition is self-limiting.  Once the growth plate has closed, the condition will resolve.  Symptoms can be improved or eliminated by decreasing the patient’s activity levels; stretching the calf muscles (<em>gastrocnemius</em>) and hamstrings; taking anti-inflammatory medication (<em>if not contra-indicated</em>); using comfort orthotics; and wearing comfort shoes. <br /><p align="right">Edited April 10, 2015</p>
Edited by <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/daniel-guss-md-2/"><em><strong>Daniel Guss, MD</strong></em></a><br /><h2>Indications</h2><br />A Weil metatarsal shortening osteotomy (bone cut) is performed to decrease pressure on a prominent metatarsal head in the forefoot.  The metatarsal head is the portion of the metatarsal bone that articulates (forms a joint) with the base of the toe. When the metatarsal is long or is positioned in such a way that the associated metatarsal head is taking a disproportionate amount of weight, pain can occur.  This source of pain in the forefoot is called <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/metatarsalgia">metatarsalgia</a></strong></em>.  A long or prominent metatarsal bone usually affects the second and, occasionally, the third metatarsal.  It is often associated with a <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/claw-toes">claw toe deformity</a> </strong></em>of the involved toe. As the toe claws, it pulls forward the cushioned fat pad normally present in the forefoot, uncovering the metatarsal head and further exposing it to pressure.<br /><h2>Procedure</h2><br />A Weil Osteotomy is performed by making an incision over the base of the second (or other involved) toe.  The surgeon exposes the far (distal) end of the involved metatarsal, the metatarsal head and the neck.  A saw is then used to cut the bone parallel to the sole of the foot.  This allows the metatarsal head to be shifted backwards towards the heel, approximately 3 to 5 mm, though in some cases even farther.  It is also possible to remove a small section (1 to 3 mm) of bone to help elevate the bone so that the metatarsal head is not as prominent.  The metatarsal head fragment is then stabilized in the new position with one or two small screws or pins.<br /><h2>Recovery</h2><br />After the surgery, the bone that has been cut needs to heal.  Therefore, no weight bearing or protected weight bearing (through the heel only) in a <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/cam-walker-walking-boot">walker boot</a></strong></em> is indicated for a period of usually six weeks, which allows the healing to occur.  Stitches are often removed 10 to 14 days after surgery.  This procedure is often done in conjunction with other procedures (example <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/bunion-hallux-valgus-procedures-bunionectomy">bunion procedures </a></strong></em>or <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/surgical-procedures/clawtoe-correction/"><em><strong>claw toe corrections</strong></em></a>), and often the recovery protocol needs to be consistent with the other procedures.  It is often at least four to six months before full recovery is obtained.<br /><h2>Potential Complications</h2><br />A Weil Osteotomy has the usual potential complications, including:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications"><i>Infection</i></a></strong></li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications"><i>Wound healing problems</i></a></strong></li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications"><i>Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) –Blood clot</i></a></strong></li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications"><i>Pulmonary embolism</i></a></strong></li><br /> 	<li><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications"><i>Nerve injury</i></a></strong></li><br /></ul><br />In addition, there are some specific potential complications associated with this procedure.  Complications that are specific to the Weil Osteotomy include:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><i>Stiffness of the joint at the base of the associated toe (ex. 2nd MTP joint)- </i>This joint tends to be stiff as there is a tendency to form a significant scar in this area.

Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/michael-shereff-md-editor/">Michael Shereff, MD</a></strong></em><br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />Freiberg’s disease is associated with pain in the forefoot.  It involves softening (osteonecrosis) of one of the metatarsal heads (Figure 1).  It usually occurs in patients that are adolescents or young teenagers that are growing.  Excessive loads applied to the area may lead to avascularity and microfracture of the metatarsal head. Freiberg’s disease is associated with swelling and localized discomfort, usually at the base of the second toe.  Patients often limp during the acute phase of the condition, although in some patients it can be chronic before it is diagnosed.  Frieberg’s disease may also be referred to as Freiberg’s infarction or Freiberg’s infraction (a combination of infarction and fracture).<br /><h2>Physical Examination</h2><br />In Freiberg’s disease, examination often reveals swelling and localized tenderness at the ball of the foot and the joint associated with the involved toe.  The joint at the base of the toe is often swollen and uncomfortable when it is palpated.  It is not uncommon for Freiberg’s disease to be associated with a long second toe, as this can increase the repetitive force that the second metatarsal head is subject to.<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />X-rays will usually allow Freiberg’s disease to be diagnosed.  They will often show a change in the shape of the affected metatarsal head (Figure 1).  The metatarsal head is the bone in the ball of the foot at the base of the toe.  X-rays will likely also demonstrate that the associated metatarsal bone is long relative to the surrounding metatarsal bones.If an MRI is ordered, there will be evidence of fluid in the joint and significant bone edema in the metatarsal head.<br /><h5>Figure 1:  Freiberg’s Infarction of the second metatarsal head</h5><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Freibergs-Infarction-Figure-1-copy.png">^media_display_589c2a44de9125bcb76932f1/position:center^</a><br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br />Most cases of Freiberg's disease are treated non-operatively.  Most often the area is protected with a<em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/comfort-shoes"> comfort shoe</a></strong></em> (a shoe with a soft rubber sole and a wide toe box) and often a <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/metatarsal-pads">metatarsal pad</a></strong></em> to help offload the area.Occasionally if symptoms are severe, an initial period of protected weight bearing with a <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/cam-walker-walking-boot">walker boot</a></strong></em> or even a cast may be helpful for a period of two weeks.  Anti-inflammatory medications may be helpful. Over time, as the inflammation resolves, the bone in the metatarsal head heals or re-vascularizes and symptoms will decrease.  However, there may be some residual deformity in the joint, resulting in mild discomfort that persists over time.<br /><h3>Surgical Treatment</h3><br />Surgical treatment of Freiberg’s is uncommon.  If non-operative management fails, there may be some benefit to cleaning out (debriding) the joint.  If the associated metatarsal is excessively long, there may be some benefit to performing a shortening osteotomy.  If there is synovitis, fragmentation or loose body within the joint, and a misshapen metatarsal head, it may be necessary to perform synovectomy, debridement, and contouring of the metatarsal head.  However, in most instances, this is a condition that is managed without surgery. <br /><p align="right">Edited January 4, 2017</p>
<p>Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/christopher-w-digiovanni-md-editor" target="_blank">Christopher DiGiovanni MD</a></strong></em></p><h2>Summary</h2><br />Pump bumps are prominent bony lumps on the outside back part of the heel. They may be asymptomatic or they may be associated with discomfort, due to irritation from shoe wear. The pump bump itself is a prominent bone on the outer aspect of the heel bone (calcaneus), near where the Achilles tendon inserts. It is sometimes called a Haglund’s deformity. Pump bumps can usually be treated with appropriate shoe wear, so as to minimize irritation to the prominent bump. Occasionally surgery to remove the bony bump and the overlying fluid filled sac (bursa) is necessary.<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />Patients with a symptomatic “pump bump” will complain of a painful lump on the back and outside part of one or both heels.  Symptoms are usually exacerbated by rubbing on the heel counter of a shoe or sneaker, and can also be aggravated by an increase in activity. Patients will often try to pad or protect the area in order to improve their symptoms, and frequently note that open backed shoewear or going barefoot lessens the mechanical irritation (but does not decrease the prominence).  They will usually report that the size of the bump can vary. However, most patients feel that the pump bump does tend to gradually increase in size over time. A history of trauma can sometimes be elicited, but this is not common. The prominence is often found by patients to be present on both feet, even though those who present with pump bumps often complain of symptoms only on one side.<br /><h2>Physical Examination</h2><br />On physical exam, a prominent bump is both visible and palpable just to the outside upper aspect of the heel (posterolateral heel). This is adjacent to where the Achilles tendon inserts into the heel bone itself.  While this bump typically involves an oversized area of bone that exists in front of and even also occasionally within the Achilles itself, it may appear on exam to involve both bone and soft tissue.  The area of irritation frequently involves a slightly swollen bursa around it. There is also usually some thickening of the skin (callusing), which the body has created over time as a means of trying to protect this spot against shoe rubbing. Patients with pump bumps usually have full mobility and strength of their foot, ankle, and lower extremity, and typically exhibit an otherwise normal foot structure and function to any further examination.<br /><h2>Imaging Study</h2><br />Pump bumps are best seen on plain x-rays taken of the ankle, heel, or foot. Imaging studies that are most often performed in patients with pump bumps include plain x-rays of the hindfoot.  Aside from noting this bony prominence posteriorly (ie, an area of bone that is normal in shape, location, and alignment, excepting its enlarged size), these are otherwise usually unremarkable.  A special axillary heel view (Harris heel view) may show an increased prominence of bone on the outside (lateral) of the foot. In more unusual cases, the area of prominence can involve a portion of the Achilles tendon itself as an arguably separate but symptomatically contributory phenomenon (ie, Achilles calcification).CT or MRI assessment is usually not indicated to make this diagnosis.  If it is performed, it will typically demonstrate some increase prominence of bone, and also often an associated fluid-filled bursal sac with some swollen soft tissue noted along the back and outside part of the heel bone (the posterolateral aspect of the calcaneus, or “heel” bone).<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br /><h3>Non-Surgical Treatment</h3><br />Most pump bumps can be successfully managed non-surgically.  The best treatment involves avoiding shoes that will irritate the inflamed and enlarged area behind the heel itself.  A softly cushioned, more forgiving, and less frictional heel counter associated with any shoe or sneaker will usually be quite helpful in alleviating the associated pain, swelling, and bursal inflammation that results from this chronic mechanical rubbing. Open back shoes are also helpful if the patient can tolerate them. Alternatively, patients can choose to insert a donut or other accommodative heel insert that is made of felt, moleskin, or other soft material, and can be placed and centered around the prominence to avoid friction directly on the site.<br /><h3>Surgical Treatment</h3><br />Occasionally, non-operative treatment will not sufficiently alleviate the discomfort associated with a pump bump because it becomes too large an area to offload. When that is the case, these prominences begin to become noticeably prominent and painful, to the point that they interfere with even routine daily activity and begin to severely restrict otherwise reasonable shoe wear choices.  In these instances, surgical resection may be a viable solution.  Surgery involves making an incision adjacent to the bump, while taking care to avoid nearby sensory nerves and the Achilles tendon, and then exposing and excising the overlying fluid-filled bursal sac along with the bony prominence itself.  The underlying bone is rasped down to a more normal level so that it no longer has a size which will serve to irritate the surrounding skin and everything else with which it comes into contact. Occasionally, bone wax is applied to minimize the risk of new bone formation after the resection, and sometimes a small portion of the Achilles must be opened to remove areas of calcification next to this, which may be contributing to its perceived size.  Once these issues have been resolved and confirmed by direct external palpation from the surgeon, the incision is then carefully closed.  It is very important that the patient be relatively immobilized, restricted in weight-bearing, and relatively inactive for the few weeks following surgery, until the incision has healed. Complete healing often takes four to six weeks until patients become satisfactorily comfortable, and this can often take even longer. Once patients are comfortable enough to freely weight bear in regular shoes without issue, they can gradually transition to their prior level of activity.<br /><h2>Potential Complications</h2><br />The most common complications specific to surgical removal (resection) of a pump bump include:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems"><strong><em>Wound healing problem</em></strong>s</a></li><br /> 	<li><em>Trouble healing the skin edges</em>: this is the most common problem, and is often associated with non-compliance or excessive activity in the early post-operative setting</li><br /></ul><br /><p>Edited on December 21, 2016 (Originally edited by <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/justin-greisberg-md-editor" target="_blank"><em><strong>Justin Greisberg, MD</strong></em></a>)</p>
Edited by <strong><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/daniel-cuttica-do-editor/">Daniel Cuttica, DO</a></em></strong><br /><h2>Summary</h2><br />The peroneal tendons are the main tendons that run along the outside part of the foot and ankle.  There are two peroneal tendons. The first is called the peroneus brevis. The term &quot;brevis&quot; implies short.  It is called this because it has a shorter muscle and starts lower in the leg. It then runs down around the back of the bone called the fibula on the outside of the leg and inserts (i.e. connects) to the fifth metatarsal.  This is on the outside part of the foot.  The peroneus longus takes its name because it has a longer course. It starts higher on the leg and runs all the way underneath the foot to insert or connect onto one of the bones (1st metatarsal) on the inside of the foot.Both tendons, however, share the major job of turning the foot outwards (everting). The tendons are held in a groove behind the back of the fibula bone and have a roof made of ligament-like tissue called the superior peroneal retinaculum (SPR).  The SPR is the main restraint to peroneal tendon subluxation.  In peroneal tendon subluxation the SPR is injured, which can cause the peroneal tendons to be prominent and pop over the edge of the prominent fibula (subluxation).<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />A patient with an acute peroneal tendon subluxation will experience pain on the back and outer part of their ankle following an injury. At the time of the injury, one of the two tendons that is normally positioned behind the fibula bone on the outside of the ankle, pops around the fibula.  When this occurs, the tendon can damage both restraining structures, including the soft tissue, known as the “superior peroneal retinaculum” (SPR), and also the bone itself.  The pain can be quite significant and can lead to a pronounced limp and, in some cases, an inability to walk.<br /><h2>Physical Examination</h2><br />On exam, patients with an acute peroneal tendon subluxation will have quite marked tenderness on the back part of the distal fibula, which is the bone on the outside of the ankle.  When the foot forced in an outward direction, (everted) the peroneal tendons may be prominent and even pop over the edge of the prominent fibula (subluxation).  This maneuver in the acute setting will create a significant amount of discomfort.<br /><h2>Imaging studies</h2><br />X-rays of patients with an acute peroneal subluxation are often normal, but may show a small rim of bone that has been pulled off (avulsed) of the back part (posterior) of the fibula.An MRI is usually not required to diagnose and treat an acute peroneal tendon subluxation.  However, if an MRI is performed, it will typically demonstrate an injury to the thick fibrous tissue, called the superior peroneal retinaculum (SPR), which normally holds the peroneal tendons in place behind the fibula.  An MRI will also demonstrate any bony avulsion injuries associated with the displacement of the peroneal retinaculum and any associated damage to the peroneal tendons themselves.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br />Treatment of an acute peroneal tendon subluxation can be non-surgical or surgical.  Treatment requires that the tendons be kept back in position behind the fibula and that they be held there until the soft tissues and any bony fragment has healed.  This requires a period of approximately six weeks of immobilization (cast or <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/foot-and-ankle-medical-supplies/cam-walker-walking-boot/"><em>walking boot</em></a>).  Following that, a rehab program is gradually started to restore the strength and function of the peroneal tendons.Nonsurgical treatment for acute injuries in active young athletes has a relatively high chance of reccurring.  Therefore, in active patients, surgical fixation of the injured SPR is often the treatment of choice, although in some instances a course of immobilization may be tried. In addition, surgical treatment of an acute peroneal subluxation is necessary when the peroneal tendons cannot be contained behind the bone on the outside of the ankle either because the associated avulsion bone fragment is too large or by the nature of the shape of the fibula.Some patients who suffer an acute peroneal subluxation will go on to develop <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/subluxing-peroneal-tendons/"><em>chronic peroneal subluxations</em></a>.  This is more likely in injuries that are missed.  These patients commonly require surgical treatment.<br /><p>Edited January 23rd, 2017</p><br /><p>Previously Edited by <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/sam-dellenbaugh/"><strong><em>Samuel Dellenbaugh, MD</em></strong></a></p>
Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/haley-merrill-md/">Haley Merrill, MD</a></strong></em>The Jones procedure is a combination of procedures to address a clawed toe deformity that involves the big (or &quot;great&quot;) toe.  The procedure includes:<br /><ol><br />	<li>Fusing the small joint in the big toe near the base of the nail;</li><br />	<li>Transferring the tendon that pulls the big toe down to the top of the big toe; and</li><br />	<li>Transferring one of the tendons that pulls the toe up into the midfoot, so that it is not excessively pulling up the big toe joint but can still help pull the foot up.</li><br /></ol><br /><h2>Indications</h2><br />The indication for this surgery is a painful clawing of the big toe.  This condition tends to occur in patients who have <strong><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/charcot-marie-tooth-disease-cmt-foot-deformities/">Charcot-Marie-Tooth</a></em></strong> or a similar condition that causes high arched feet.  A Jones procedure is often performed as part of a larger operation.<br /><h2>Procedure</h2><br /><i>1. Big Toe Tendon Transfer (Flexor Hallucis Longus Transfer)</i>The tendon that pulls the big toe down (flexor hallucis longus) is transferred to the base of the bone of the great toe (proximal phalanx). This is usually done through an incision on the side of the big toe. This tendon is identified and then cut near where it inserts in the bone towards the tip of the toe. The tendon is then moved along the side of the big toe to the top of the toe. It may also be transferred through a hole drilled in the bone at the base of the great toe (proximal phalanx). Securing it there allows it to pull the whole toe down, where before it was pulling down just the last knuckle by itself (contributing to the claw toe).<i>2. Interphalangeal Joint Fusion of the Great Toe</i>The second procedure involves a fusion of the small joint in the toe.  This joint can be approached through the same incision that was made to harvest the tendon.  The joint is identified.  The cartilage is removed.  The joint is then fused with a screw and/or wires.<i>3. Extensor hallucis longus tendon transfer to foot.  </i>The tendon that pulls the big toe up (extensor hallucis longus) is released, often through the same incision.  It is then transferred up into the midfoot.  The purpose of this is to decrease the force pulling the toe upwards, but still allow this muscle to work in the foot, as it is important to continue to have this force pulling the foot itself up.<br /><h2><b>Recovery  </b></h2><br />The recovery from a Jones procedure is often dictated by other procedures, such as fusion in the midfoot or hindfoot that may have a more prolonged recovery time.  An isolated Jones procedure typically requires six weeks to allow the bone to heal; and during that time, partial or full weightbearing may be possible through to heel.  It is important that the foot be elevated to minimize swelling and that appropriate pain control is instituted.<br /><h2><b>Potential Complications  </b></h2><br /><h4><i>General Complications</i></h4><br />This combination procedure has a typical array of general complications that include:<em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#infection">Infection</a></strong></em><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems">Wound healing problems</a></strong></em><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#dvt">Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)</a></strong></em><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#pe">Pulmonary embolism</a></strong></em><br /><h4><i>Specific Complications</i></h4><br />Complications that are specific to this surgery include:<br /><ul><br />	<li>Injury to the nerves supplying sensation to the tip of the toe</li><br />	<li>Nonunion of the interphalangeal joint.</li><br />	<li>Malunion of the fusion (interphalangeal joint) if this heals in an abnormal position.</li><br />	<li>Failure of the tendon transfers to take hold with resulting dysfunction and/or poor position.</li><br /></ul><br /><p align="right">Edited September 18, 2015 (Originally edited by <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/judith-smith-md/"><strong><em>Judith Smith, MD</em></strong></a>)</p><br />

Edited by <strong><em><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/dave-townshend-md/">Dave Townshend, MBBS</a></em></strong>Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) of the foot and ankle is becoming more common. These procedures are performed through small incisions instead of one large incision. The advantage of MIS is that the incisions are small and therefore patients often have quicker recovery times and less discomfort than with conventional surgery. The potential disadvantage of MIS is that in some instances it may be more difficult for the surgeon to see the pathology that needs to be addressed and perform the operation that needs to be done.During a minimally invasive procedure, surgeons make several small incisions in the skin. Specialised instruments can then be passed through these incisions to allow the surgeon to perform the operation. Sometimes a small camera (called an endoscope or arthroscope) is passed through one of the incisions to give the surgeon a view of what is inside. Sometimes an x-ray is used to show the surgeon where the instruments are.If the surgeon is unable to perform the surgery adequately or cannot gain a good enough view the procedure may be converted to use a larger incision.An operation should only be performed as a minimally invasive surgery if the surgeon is confident that the outcome would be as good or better than with a large incision. Your surgeon will be able to discuss this with you.Not all procedures can (or should) be done through minimally invasive methods.

<h2>Summary</h2><br />Bleeding under the toenail (a subungal hematoma) is often associated with intense pain.  It may occur after dropping an object on the toe or getting the toe caught between two hard surfaces. Alternatively, it may occur by repetitive trauma against the front of a shoe such as may occur in long distance running (runner’s toe). It commonly involves the great toe although other toes may be involved. After being struck by an object bleeding can occur in the nail bed trapping blood under the toenail.  The pressure from the bleeding creates a space between the toenail and the underlying soft tissue (Matrix) that is intensely painful. Subungal hematomas are treated by releasing (decompressing) the collection of blood under the toenail. This helps relieve the pressure and associated pain. If this does not occur the bleeding may be resorbed over time or it may resolve over many months as the toenail grows out. In some instances patients may lose the toenail although it will tend to grow back over time.<br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />A subungal hematoma occurs when trauma to the toenail causes bleeding under the toenail. Dropping a heavy object on the toe in one common cause, although repetitive trauma to the toenail from long distance running in tight fitting shoes (runner’s toe) may also cause a subungal hematoma. It is usually the great toe that is affected. This condition is characterized by intense pain. Bleeding or bruising under the toenail is seen -often at the base of the toenail.<br /><h2>Physical Examination</h2><br />Blood that is often bluish in color will be seen under the toenail (Figure 1).  Swelling of the toe itself is often seen.  Movement or manipulation of the Toenail will aggravate the pain. Occasionally blood will be seen leaking out the side of the toenail.<br /><h5>Figure 1:  Subungal hematoma of the Great Toe</h5><br />^media_display_589c2a51de9125bcb7693308/position:center^<br /><h2>Imaging Studies</h2><br />X-rays maybe normal or they may demonstrate a <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/toe-fractures/">fracture of toe</a>.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br />Treating a subungal hematoma ideally involves relieving the pressure caused by the build up of blood underneath the toenail. This is done by boring a hole through the top of the toenail and expressing the blood that. This is followed by icing, elevation, limiting standing and walking, and the use of a comfort shoe. If the blood is not released it will eventually solidify and over time as the toenail grows out the blood will be resorbed. However, this may create dissociation between the toenail and the underlying soft tissue. In some cases the subungual hematoma will cause the toenail to fall off. If this occurs the toenail will be replaced over time with a new toenail. This occurs slowly at a rate of about 2mm/month. <br /><p>Edited by <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/editors/stephen-pinney-md-editor-in-chief/">Stephen Pinney MD</a> October 17th 2016</p>
<a href="http://www.footeducation.com/2017/02/01/toe-injury-decides-fate-super-bowl-li/"><h2>Toe Injury Decides the Fate of Super Bowl LI???</h2><div><br /></div></a>
<em>Will a toe injury determine this year’s Super Bowl winner?</em>  If the Atlanta Falcon’s explosive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julio_Jones">All-Pro receiver Julio Jones</a> has a dominant performance the Falcon’s will likely be raising the Lombardi trophy –but if he is held in check by the New England Patriot’s #1 rated defense it will more than likely be the Patriots receiving the trophy from Commissioner Roger Goodell.
<br />
<br />Jones’ ability to break free of the Patriot’s secondary may be dictated by how much pain he has in his left great toe.  Jones suffered a dreaded <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/turf-toe/">“turf toe”</a> injury back during the Falcon’s week 10 game against Philadelphia. He then <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/2017/1/14/14275918/julio-jones-foot-injury-seahawks-vs-falcons">reinjured the toe in the Falcon’s divisional playoff game against the Seahawks</a>. However, he was back on the field for the NFC conference championship game which the Falcon’s won handily over the Green Bay Packers. Will he have residual symptoms or reinjure the toe in the Super Bowl? How much will the toe limit him in Sunday’s game? The answers to those questions will play out during Super Bowl LI and may ultimately determine the winner.
<br />
<h2><em><br /></em></h2><h2><em>Turf Toe: what is it all about?</em></h2>
<br />So what is a turf toe?  And why is it such a potentially devastating injury for an NFL wide receiver? A turf toe injury is a tearing of some, or all, of the strong joint capsule at the base of the big toe. The most dramatic example of a turf toe injury is an actual dislocation of the big toe joint (1st metatarsal-phalangeal joint).  To dislocate this joint, even if it subsequently pops back into place (as it often does), requires that the strong fibrous tissue at the base of the joint (Plantar plate) be completely disrupted. More commonly, but also quite serious, is a partial injury to the plantar plate –the strong fibrous tissue being partially torn. The most common mechanism causing a turf toe injury is when the <a href="http://www.texasfootdoctor.org/images/turf%20toe.gif">big toe is forced upwards after it is jammed into the ground</a>. However, injury to the plantar ligaments may also occur from repetitive loading rather than one specific injury.
<br />
<h2><em><br /></em></h2><h2><em>Problems with Turf Toe</em></h2>
<br />There are at least three elements to this injury that create problems:
<br />
<br />First, tearing the plantar plate (the strong tissue that stabilizes the base of the big toe joint) causes bleeding around and in the joint.  Blood flow to the great toe is increased for months afterwards as the toe tries to heal. This leads to swelling, aching, and general discomfort –especially if the injured player tries to use the toe.  Imagine running after you had dropped a large rock on your big toe –Ouch!
<br />
<br />Second, the injury may have done more than just tear the lower part of the joint capsule. Other structures can be damaged including the joint cartilage that allows the joint to move smoothly (and painlessly) back and forth (cartilage is the shiny white stuff on the end of a chicken bone).  If enough cartilage is damaged in the <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/hallux-rigidus-hallux-limitus/">great toe significant arthritis</a> in this joint can develop.
<br />
<br />Third, the torn plantar plate (ligament) may not completely heal.  This can cause the joint to be loose and subject to chronic pain and re-injury.
<br />
<h2><em><br /></em></h2><h2><em>Treatment and Recovery</em></h2>
<br />How is a turf toe treated? Initially, rest, ice, compression, and elevation (R.I.C.E) is used to help settle the acute pain –this can take anywhere form a few days to a few weeks to settle. Keeping the toe relatively immobilized to allow for healing of the injured structures is critical.  This may be done initially by putting the injured player in a<a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/foot-and-ankle-medical-supplies/cam-walker-walking-boot/"> rigid-soled walker boot</a>, and then transition them to a stiff-soled shoe.  This usually serves to settle the symptoms over time in an average person who can back off their activities.
<br />
<br />But, what about an elite NFL receiver like Julio Jones? His success on the field is dependent upon his ability to explode off the line of scrimmage, and leap high into the air to catch passes all the while he is being covered by ridiculously strong, fast, and large defensive players. He needs every advantage he can get to separate from these defenders. The force and motion going through his great toe joint as he does these maneuvers is staggering -often many, many times his body weight. This is not only extremely painful, but can (and often does) disrupt the healing process.
<br />
<br />Doctors and trainers can help manage these symptoms with shoe modifications (stiffening the soles) and perhaps various types of injections.  However, shoes that are too stiff and restrictive may limit the performance of player’s like Jones. For some players this balancing act is negotiated successful and the player can play at near 100%.  For others, the limitations can be profound causing them to miss games and perhaps require surgery to clean out the great toe joint and repair the damaged joint capsule. It remains to be seen to what extent Julio Jones is affected by his toe injury. Hopefully he is at 100% and Super Bowl LI is a great game.  Enjoy it!

<a href="http://www.footeducation.com/2017/01/25/5-risk-factors-ankle-sprains/"><h2>5 Risk Factors for Ankle Sprains</h2></a>
  ^media_display_589c2a39de9125bcb76932cc^
<em>An <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/sprained-ankle/">ankle sprain</a> or &quot;rolling your ankle&quot; is one of the most common musculoskeletal injuries. However, not every person has an equal risk of spraining her ankle. Are you more likely than the next person to suffer an ankle sprain? Here are five risk factors:</em>
<br />
<br /><strong>1. A history of ankle sprains</strong>
<br />If you have sprained your ankle many times in the past you are likely to sprain it again in the future. Often these individuals will have a combination of the other risk factors. They may have developed chronic <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/ankle-instability/">ankle instability</a> due to stretching out of the injured ligaments.
<br />
<br /><strong>2. Participation in high-risk sports<br /></strong>Certain sports predispose to ankle sprains more than others. Basketball and volleyball players who often land awkwardly on someone's foot after jumping have an increased risk of injury. Similarly, soccer and tennis players who regularly have to change directions quickly also commonly suffer ankle sprains.
<br />
<br /><strong>3. Loose joints</strong>
<br />Are you “loose-jointed”? In medicine, this is called “ligamentous laxity.” Can you hyperextend your elbows? Can you touch your thumb to your forearm? Can you bend a finger so that it makes a 90° angle with the back of your hand? If you can, you have looser ligaments and are at a higher risk of spraining your ankle.
<br />
<br /><strong>4. A high arched foot</strong>
<br />People with<a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-basics/biomechanics-of-foot-and-ankle/foot-types/characteristics-of-high-arched-foot-subtle-cavus/"> higher arched feet</a> can usually roll their foot inwards more than they can outwards. This makes it more likely that they will sprain their ankle.
<br />
<br /><strong>5. Weak muscles</strong>
<br />When your ankle rolls inwards, often the last thing that prevents it from going further and tearing the ligaments is a strong contraction from the muscles on the side of the leg that supports the ankle. If these muscles are weak or do not react in time, an ankle sprain will occur. Most people with weak muscles do not realize it; because the only time they need this strength is when the ankle is in a “high-risk” position for spraining. Keeping these muscles strong can help minimize the risk of an ankle sprain.

<br />  ^media_display_58a696da3fdff75aae8ef212/position:center^
<br />
<ol>
    <br />
    <li><strong>The term &quot;bunion&quot; is derived from the Latin word for turnip. </strong>The medical term for bunions is Hallux (big toe) Valgus (pointing away from the midline).</li>
    <br />
</ol>
<br />
<ol>
    <br />
    <li><strong>Tight shoes do NOT cause bunions. </strong>Rather, you can usually blame your parents. More than 80% of patient with bunions have a first-degree family member with a bunion. However, if you have a bunion and wear constrictive shoes it will cause pain –so comfortable shoes are still very important!</li>
    <br />
</ol>
<br />
<ol>
    <br />
    <li><strong>There's very little correlation between the size of a bunion and how painful it is. </strong>It is natural to think that a big bunion = lots of pain, and a small bunion = very little pain.  However, that is not the case. Small bunions can be very painful, and many large bunions cause no symptoms at all.</li>
    <br />
</ol>
<br />
<ol>
    <br />
    <li><strong> The vast majority of bunions can be treated effectively without surgery. </strong>Only a small percentage of patients with bunions will need surgery. Most bunions can be managed effectively without surgery. Simple non-surgical treatments like wearing a shoe with more width and a softer upper can be very effective at decreasing or eliminating bunion symptoms.</li>
    <br />
</ol>
<br />
<ol>
    <br />
    <li><strong>Bunion surgery is not a cosmetic procedure. </strong>Bunions that are not painful should not be operated on. The recovery from surgery is considerable and “there is no operation that has ever been invented that can’t conceivably have a complication.” These are two of the reasons why performing cosmetic bunion surgery (surgery in the absence of significant symptoms of discomfort) has been identified by the “<a href="http://www.choosingwisely.org/">Choose Wisely</a>” campaign as an unnecessary procedure.</li>

Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/haley-merrill-md/">Haley Merrill, MD</a></strong></em><br /><h2>Indication</h2><br />A Proximal Chevron osteotomy is a surgical procedure to correct a moderate<em><strong> <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/bunions-hallux-valgus">bunion</a></strong></em> deformity.  It is one of many different types of <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/bunion-hallux-valgus-procedures-bunionectomy">bunion procedures</a></strong></em> that may be performed. The proximal chevron osteotomy involves an incision on the inside (medial aspect) of the forefoot, followed by two angled bone cuts (osteotomy) through the base of the 1st metatarsal (the bone that leads to the great toe).  The wedge-shaped bone cut allows the distal part (end closest to the toe) of the metatarsal bone to be translated in a lateral direction, moving it towards the little toe, to improve the overall alignment of the 1st metatarsal, thereby helping to correct the bunion deformity.  The cut bone fragments are then stabilized with screws or a plate.  This procedure is usually combined with a <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/great-toe-medial-capsulorraphy-1st-mtp">1st MTP joint capsularraphy</a></strong></em>.<br /><h2>Procedure</h2><br />As this procedure involves cutting the bone, a period of limited weight-bearing for about 6 weeks is required to allow the bone to heal. <br /><p align="right">Edited on December 17, 2015</p><div></div>

An AFO is an orthotic device that attaches to the lower leg and foot to control the ankle joint. An AFO helps to keep the ankle in a neutral position (90 degrees to the lower leg).  It is often made of molded plastic or graphite, and fit to the patient's lower leg (Figure 1).  It is often custom fit by an orthotist, although &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; AFOs are available.  The orthotist can perform alterations, such as adding padding to certain areas or reshaping certain areas, to improve the fit of the AFO. Hinged AFOs have a hinge built into the area above the ankle to allow for upward ankle motion (dorsiflexion).<br /><h5>Figure 1: Plastic heat molded AFO (Basic unit)</h5><br />[Content: /wp-content/uploads/2010/08/AFO.bmp Goes Here]<br /><h2>Who may benefit from using an AFO?</h2><br />Patients who have a drop foot or significant hindfoot arthritis (<em>ankle, subtalar, and/or talonvicular joints</em>) may benefit from using an AFO. The AFO will keep the ankle remain in a neutral position, which will allow patients with a drop foot to walk with a much more normal gait (the involved leg will not need to be lifted as high in order for the foot to &quot;clear&quot; the ground). The AFO also serves to significantly limit motion though the joints of the hindfoot, and this will help to limit the pain stimulus from arthritic joints in this area (less joint movement often translates to less pain when a joint has significant arthritis). <br /><p>Edited September 24, 2015</p><br /><p></p>
 
<h2>Indication</h2><br />An ankle fusion (Figure 1) is indicated for patients with painful end-stage <em><strong><a href="/ankle-arthritis">ankle arthritis</a></strong></em>. The arthritis can be the result of osteoarthritis, posttraumatic arthritis, arthritis from systemic cause, such as <em><strong><a href="/rheumatoid-arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</a></strong></em>, or even avascular necrosis.<br /><h4>Figure 1: Ankle Joint Fusion (Arthrodesis)</h4><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/ankle-fusion-Figure-1a.jpg">^media_display_589c29c6de9125bcb7693170/position:center^</a><br /><h4>Figure 2 Ankle Fusion Side (Lateral) View</h4><br /><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/ankle-fusion-Figure-1b.jpg">^media_display_589c29c7de9125bcb7693173/position:center^</a>When considering an ankle fusion, it is important to assess the joints surrounding the ankle joint, including the subtalar joint and the talonavicular joint (See Figure #2). The reason for this is that these joints will be subject to more motion and more force once the ankle joint has been fused. The status of these joints is important in assessing how successful an ankle fusion is likely to be. If these joints have full range of motion and no evidence of arthritis, good results can be expected with a successful ankle fusion. If there is significant arthritis or stiffness involving these joints, then the results of an ankle fusion may be less predictable.<br /><h2>Procedure</h2><br />The ankle fusion is performed by removing any remaining cartilage from the tibial and talar surfaces of the ankle joint. The underlying bone is then prepared with a combination of instruments to create fresh bony surfaces that can knit together in a similar manner to the way a fracture would heal. These surfaces are then fixed in position with strong screws or plates (Figure 1). The actual position of the ankle joint is critical in performing a successful ankle fusion. The joint should be positioned in neutral dorsiflexion (right angles to the lower leg) and in slight hindfoot valgus (the heel angled slightly to the outside). This allows the most motion through the surrounding joints.The ankle is often approached through an incision on the outside (lateral) aspect of the ankle. It is common to require another incision at the front of the ankle as well. It is also common to cut the smaller bone of the lower leg (the fibula) and reposition that so that it is included in the fusion mass, in order to approach the ankle.As well, it is common to augment the ankle fusion with bone graft. This can be taken from just below the knee or from the pelvis. The cellular elements in the bone graft help improve the chance of the rate of ankle fusion.<br /><h2>Recovery</h2><br />Patients undergoing an ankle fusion typically require:<em>0-6 (or 8) weeks Post-surgery</em>Patients use crutches (or a wheelchair) and mobilize without bearing any weight on the operated leg for the first 6-8 weeks after surgery, in order for the ankle fusion to heal. During this time, patients are usually in a cast, or cast-boot.<em>6 (or 8) - 12 weeks Post-surgery</em>At 6 or 8 weeks post operation, if x-rays demonstrates satisfactory healing, patients are then allowed to begin weight-bearing as tolerated in a protective cast boot. This boot can be removed to allow showering and physical therapy. At this point, physical therapy is started. Patients will work on strengthening their muscles, improving their gait, and working on their range of motion. They are typically walking in a cast boot, walking with a cane, or walking with other assistive device.<em>10-12 + Weeks Post-surgery</em>At that point, patients can begin walking in a shoe - often with a supportive ankle device, such as an <em><strong><a href="/ankle-lacers">ankle lacer</a></strong></em>. They will be asked to gradually increase their activity level during the coming months. A rapid increase in activity level will often cause a sudden increase in symptoms, such as pain and swelling. If this happens, patients should back off their activity level for 2-4 days until their symptoms settle down.Patient will obtain approximately 80% of their recovery by the 6 month mark. However, it is often 15 or even 18 months before a patient reaches their point of maximal improvement.<br /><h2>Potential General Complications</h2><br /><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#infection">Infection</a></strong></em><br /><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#asymmetric-gait">Asymmetric Gait (leading to pain elsewhere)</a></strong></em><br /><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#dvt">Deep Vein Thrombosis (Blood Clot)</a></strong></em><br /><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#infection">Infection</a></strong></em><br /><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#pe">Pulmonary Embolism (PE)</a></strong></em><br /><em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#wound-healing-problems">Wound Healing Problems</a></strong></em><br /><h2>Potential Specific Complications</h2><br /><h4><strong><em>Nonunion</em></strong></h4><br /><h4>A nonunion occurs when the fusion site fails to adequately knit together. The nonunion rate is dependent upon: the surgical technique; the patient's underlying condition; whether the patient smokes cigarettes; and the patient's compliance with the postoperative non weight-bearing protocol. The typical nonunion rate is on the order of 5-10%. If a patient does have a nonunion or a delayed union, they may require a longer period of non weight-bearing and, in some instances, will require revision surgery.</h4><br /><h4><strong><em>Nerve Injury</em></strong></h4><br />Fortunately, injuries to nerves are relatively uncommon in ankle fusions. Nevertheless, given the extensive nature of the procedure, on occasion the major nerve at the back of the hindfoot [the tibial nerve] will be stretched or injured, leading to abnormal sensation (or loss of sensation) in the sole (plantar aspect) of the foot. This can lead to the development of significant pain over the course of the nerve or even to the development of <em><strong><a href="/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications#crps">Complex regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS)</a></strong></em>Small sensory nerves may also be damaged or cut during the operation. This occasionally leads to loss of sensation in part of the foot (usually around the incision) and, in a small percentage of patients, may even lead to painful nerve type symptoms. If a small nerve is irritated and creates pain, it needs to be treated with fairly aggressive desensitization (massage) therapy performed by a physical therapist.<br /><h4><strong><em>Continued Pain</em></strong></h4><br />Some pain may still be present after a successful ankle fusion. It is important to appreciate that an ankle fusion is highly successful in eradicating the pain that originates from the arthritic ankle joint. However, it will have no appreciable effect on symptoms that are originating from ligaments and tendons outside of the ankle joint, or on arthritis that involves any of the surrounding joints. In fact, arthritis in the surrounding joints, such as the subtalar and talonavicular joint, may actually be worsened.<br /><p><span style="font-size: 10px;">Edited March 8, 2015<br /></span></p>
The following procedures are commonly used as surgical treatment for bunions. The type of procedure used will depend on: the extent of the deformity, the characteristics of the patient, and the preference of the surgeon.<em><strong><a href="/chevron-osteotomy-distal-for-hallux-vallgus-bunion">Chevron Osteotomy</a></strong></em><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/lapidus-procedure-for-hallux-valgus-bunion-correction">Lapidus Procedure</a></strong></em><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/surgical-procedures/bunion-hallux-valgus-procedures-bunionectomy/proximal-metatarsal-osteotomy-for-bunion-hallux-valgus-correction/">Proximal Metatarsal Osteotomy</a></strong></em> <em>including</em>:<br /><ul><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/ludloff-procedure-bunion-surgery">Ludloff Osteotomy</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/cresentic-osteotomy-bunion-correction">Cresentic Osteotomy</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/scarf-osteotomy">SCARF Osteotomy</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-conditions/proximal-chevron-osteotomy-bunion-correction/">Proximal Chevron</a></strong></em></li><br />	<li><em><strong><a href="/great-toe-fusion-1st-mtp-joint-fusion">Great Toe Fusion</a></strong></em></li><br /></ul><br /><p>Edited March 27, 2015</p>
<h2>Procedure</h2><br />A midfoot fusion is performed to treat <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/midfoot-arthritis">midfoot arthritis</a></strong></em>.  The procedure involves fusion of one or more of the first three tarsometatarsal (TMT) joints.  The second TMT joint is most commonly involved, but the first and third may also be affected by arthritis.  Typically the 4th and 5th TMT joints are not fused, as these joints have more motion than the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd TMT joints.Fusing the joints involves removing any remaining cartilage, creating a bony surface that can heal, and then stabilizing the joints with screws or a plate.  Any prominent midfoot bone spurs (<em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/tarsal-boss/">Tarsal Boss</a></strong></em>) would be removed at the time of surgery.  Patients are instructed to remain non-weight-bearing or to limit their weight bearing for 6-8 weeks, until the joints have fused.  This procedure essentially turns a painful, stiff, arthritis joint into a painless, fused joint.<br /><h2>Potential Complications</h2><br />Complications including <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications">non-union</a>, <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications">delayed union</a>,<a href="http://www.footeducation.com/foot-and-ankle-surgical-complications"> nerve injury</a>, and <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/painful-hardware">painful hardware</a> can occur.<br /><p align="right">Edited February 1, 2017</p>

Bone graft harvesting is either done to increase the chance of a successful joint fusion (ex. ankle fusion, subtalar fusion, talonavicular fusion) or to help a non-union heal. The soft (cancellous) bone is scooped out and packed into the area where the bone healing is required.  The bone graft helps healing in three ways:<br /><ol><br />	<li><em>It provides a scaffold for new bone to form on;</em></li><br />	<li><em>The bone graft provides a stimulus for healing elements (growth factors, etc) to migrate to the healing area; and</em></li><br />	<li><em>Bone cells (osteocytes) found in the bone graft may produce new bone directly</em></li><br /></ol><br />Common sites for harvesting bone graft in foot and ankle surgery include: the proximal tibial, the iliac crest, and the calcaneus. There is some suggestion that the closer to the center of the body, the better quality the bone graft (i.e. iliac crest may be better than proximal tibial bone graft which may be better than a calcaneal bone graft).Bone graft taken from the patient and transferred to another area of the body is called an autograft, whereas bone that is taken from a cadaver is called an allograft. Allograft lacks the bone stimulating properties of autograft bone. There are now also a number of &quot;bone graft substitutes&quot; that attempt to stimulate bone formation by including bone stimulating elements (ex. platelet derived growth factors, bone morphogenic proteins, etc.) within the substance.<br /><p>Edited March 27, 2015</p><br />  
In some active young patients, it may be beneficial to try and fuse the two bones of the lower leg (tibia and fibula) together (tibiofibular osteosynthesis or Ertl procedure). This has the potential advantage of creating a more stable amputation stump. However, it is associated with a longer recovery period (to allow the bones to heal) and the possibility that the two bones will not heal, leading to a non-union that may be symptomatic.<br /><p>Edited April 17, 2015</p>

It’s indicated for significant claw toe deformities that have failed non-operative treatment. The claw toe deformity develops as a result of muscle imbalance. This procedure is designed to address this type of muscle imbalance, so that the correction of the deformity is maintained over time.<br /><h2>Procedure:</h2><br />The flexor to extensor transfer can be performed in a couple of ways. An incision over the top aspect of the toe can be performed, and the dissection can be taken down the side of the toe so that the tendon that flexes the toe (Flexor Digitorum Longus) is identified on the underside of the toe. This tendon is then cut and transferred to the top of the toe at the base.  As a result, this tendon will cause the base of the toe to be pulled down, rather than flexing the tip of the toe and increasing the claw toe deformity.  This creates a more stable position for the toe.  The tendon that is transferred is sutured into the extensor tendon.This procedure may also be performed by harvesting the flexor tendon through a separate incision on the undersurface of toe.  The tendon is then transferred up to the top of the toe, either through the PIP joint or along the side of the toe. It is again sutured into the associated sheath of the extensor tendon.<br /><h2>Recovery:</h2><br />It’s important that the transferred tendon has sufficient time to heal. This requires limited loading and relative immobilization of the healing tendon for about 6 weeks after the surgery. During this time, it is usually protected with a screw or a pin.<br /><h2>Potential Surgical Complications:</h2><br /><h4><i>Specific Complications</i></h4><br />Complications that are relatively specific to a claw toe correction a Flexor to Extensor transfer (Girdlestone-Taylor procedure) include:<br /><ul><br />	<li>Failure of the transfer tendon.</li><br />	<li>Tendon is pulled out of the area that it was transferred in.</li><br />	<li>Misalignment of the toe.</li><br />	<li>Occasionally, the direction of the pull of the tendon can be such that the toe will move out of the desired alignment.</li><br />	<li>Increased swelling.</li><br />	<li>Increased pain.</li><br />	<li>Vascular injury.</li><br />	<li>Although uncommon, the blood vessels supplying the tip of the toe may be damaged, causing necrosis and occasionally loss of the tip of the toe.</li><br /></ul><br /><h4><i>General Complications</i></h4><br />In addition to the specific complications listed above, there is the potential for the following general complications:<br /><ul><br />	<li>Infection</li><br />	<li>Wound healing problems</li><br />	<li>Nerve injury</li><br />	<li>Blood clots (Deep Vein Thrombosis / DVT) –uncommon in toe surgery</li><br />	<li>Pulmonary embolism –uncommon in toe surgery</li><br /></ul><br /><p>Edited on July 31, 2015 (Originally edited by <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/stephen-pinney-md-editor-in-chief" target="_blank"><strong><em>Stephen Pinney, MD</em></strong></a>)</p>
Edited by <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/judith-smith-md">Judith Smith, MD</a></strong></em><br /><h2>Clinical Presentation</h2><br />Toenail fungus (onychomycosis) is a common, often asymptomatic abnormality affecting toe nails. Patients complain of unsightly looking toenails but rarely have significant symptoms.  Trauma to the nail bed can also cause nail deformity and is part of the differential diagnosis.  Toenail fungal infections are characterized by any of the following symptoms: yellow streaks or discoloration of the nail bed, discolored and thickened toenails, brittle and thickened nails, soft and powdery nail surfaces, white spots or streaks on the nail surface, build ups of pieces of skin and nail fragment under the nail bed and damaged brown or grey nail surfaces. The condition is caused by fungus (dermatophyte), a common fungi tricophyton, microsporum, epidermophyton, or yeast candida albicans. The condition is more common in patients with diabetes and in some instances may lead to increasing morbidities in these patients. Diagnosis is made by clinical examination, or by microscopic evidence of fungal elements from scrapings.<br /><h2>Treatment</h2><br />Eradicating a fungal infection has proven difficult because the infection is embedded deep within the nail and is difficult to reach. Treatment may focus on controlling the condition or eradicating it. Traditional treatment options have included:<br /><h4><i>Local treatments such as nail lacquer</i></h4><br />For mild to moderate toenail fungus, a topical anti-fungal can be of benefit. The lacquer is applied daily to the affected nail. Improvement in the nail is often achieved after an extended period of time (1 year). The issue with this approach is that the lacquer often poorly penetrates the nail plate.  As a result, this treatment may be very effective in terms of controlling the condition and producing improved nails, however, it only eradicates the infection in less than 10 percent of patients.<br /><h4><i>Oral medication, such as, terbinafine or itraconazole</i></h4><br />Oral anti-fungals (itraconazole and terbinafine) can be taken once daily by mouth for a variable period of time usually 12 weeks with reasonable success of eradicating the fungal infection (on the order 60-70 percent success). The problem with this treatment in addition to cost is the potential for serious liver problems.  These medications are metabolized in the liver and have been associated with elevated liver enzymes and liver failure, potentially leading to the need for liver transplant or death. As a result of this, in July 2001 the FDA consumer updates outlined a health advisory delineating the serious risks of these medications. However, for patients who otherwise have a healthy liver these medications are likely to be well tolerated provided the effects are closely monitored by a physician.<br /><h4><i>Laser therapy</i></h4><br />Laser therapy is becoming increasingly popular for the treatment of fungal infections. There are different types of lasers and each requires a different treatment protocol. There is a general lack of peer-reviewed data on laser treatment.  However, there are retrospective studies that suggest that they may be of some benefit. Laser is thought to work by penetrating the nail and killing the fungi.<br /><p align="right"> edited October 28, 2016</p>
<h2>Indications</h2><br />Indications for extracorporeal shockwave therapy are <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/plantar-fasciitis">plantar fasciitis</a></strong></em> that has failed to respond to adequate, non-operative treatment over a prolonged period of time.<br /><h2>Procedure</h2><br />Extracorporeal shockwave therapy involves a blast of shockwave into the soft tissue in the area of the <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/plantar-fasciitis">plantar fasciitis</a></strong></em>.  This is very similar to what is used to break up kidney stones.  These waves cause a localized injury to the plantar fascia where it attaches to the heel bone (calcaneus), and where the inflammation and irritation that create the plantar fasciitis symptoms are located.  The response to this injury includes the body sending increased blood flow and inflammatory mediators into this area, and these are thought to help improve or resolve the symptoms from the <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/plantar-fasciitis">plantar fasciitis</a></strong></em>.  Essentially this technique involves stirring up the soft tissue to create a healing response, which then leads to improvement in symptoms.There are two broad categories of extracorporeal shockwave treatment.  The first is high-energy shockwaves which are quite painful and therefore patient's need to undergo some type of anesthetic either general anesthetic or a local field block.  The second is a milder lower intensity shockwave that is performed over a longer period of time and maybe performed over multiple sessions.  This does not require an anesthetic but there are some questions as to its efficacy.<br /><h2>Recovery</h2><br />When a high intensity shockwave therapy is administered to the foot, it is quite painful during the recovery period. Therefore patients are encouraged to keep the foot immobilized in a walker boot, and to be non-weight bearing or minimal weight bearing until their symptoms have improved.  This time can vary from a few days to a few weeks.<br /><h2>Specific Complications</h2><br />Potential complications associated with ESWT include:<br /><ul><br />	<li><i>Pain. </i>Even though this procedure does not break the skin, it does create significant microscopic tissue injury that can be quite painful.  In response to this tissue damage, there is often significant initial pain, which should resolve over the ensuing weeks.</li><br />	<li><i>Recurrence of symptoms or failure to irradiate the symptoms. </i>There remains unresolved questions as to the ultimate effectiveness of this treatment, particularly the lower intensity treatment.  Reasonable short-term results have been demonstrated over three to six months following this type of procedure.  However, the recurrence of symptoms over time is not insignificant.  One of the issues is that the tissue still remains damage.  Furthermore, ESWT does not address the factors that predispose to the development of <em><strong><a href="http://www.footeducation.com/plantar-fasciitis">plantar fascists</a></strong></em>, such as a tight calf muscle; a job that requires prolonged standing; or excessive weight.</li><br /></ul><br /> <br /><p align="right">Edited May 2, 2015</p><div><hr /></div>
